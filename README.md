# Bumasys Alfa

## Project Overview
Bumasys Alfa is a Vuetify powered Vue application scaffold. It provides a minimal setup to experiment with Vuetify 3 features and serves as a starting point for new projects.

## Installation Instructions
Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to install dependencies for the front end:

```bash
cd fe
pnpm install
```

## Usage Guide
Start a development server with hot reloading:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build the project for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Examples
After running the development server, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The navigation drawer links (Home, People, Teams, Tasks, Budget, References, and Users) each lead to a dedicated page that you can further extend. Edit components in `src/` to continue customizing the application.

## Contributing Guidelines
1. Fork the repository and create feature branches for your work.
2. Run `pnpm run lint` before opening a pull request.
3. Follow conventional commit messages for clarity.
