### 2025-01-15 - Frontend Test Fix: Numeric Validation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- One failing test in `useValidation.test.ts` was expecting legacy permissive numeric validation behavior
- Legacy test expected `"12a"` to be considered valid (using `parseFloat` behavior)
- Updated `validateNumeric` function now uses strict validation with `Number()` constructor
- Conflict between old test expectations and new stricter validation logic

#### Impact of Changes:
- All 263 frontend tests now pass
- Validation behavior is now consistent between legacy and new tests
- Numeric input validation is stricter and more reliable for user inputs

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Frontend Test Failure**: Updated legacy test in `useValidation.test.ts` to expect strict numeric validation
  - Changed expectation for `"12a"` from `true` to `"Must be a valid number"`
  - Aligned test with new stricter validation that rejects strings with trailing non-numeric characters
  - Maintains backwards compatibility for valid numeric inputs while improving input validation quality

#### Code Changes:
- **Updated Files:**
  - `/fe/tests/unit/composables/useValidation.test.ts`: Updated test expectation to match strict validation behavior
