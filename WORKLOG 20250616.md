## Change Log for June 16, 2025

### 2025-06-16 - Task Status Report and Progress Report Creator Staff Implementation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The system required modification of Task Status Report and Progress Report entities to include a creator Staff field. When these reports are created, a report creator needs to be set who is one of the Staff assigned to the Task or the evaluator of the Task. The requirement was to auto-detect the creator when the logged-in user's email matches one of the eligible staff members.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Data Model Enhancement**: Added `creatorId` field to both TaskStatusReport and TaskProgress interfaces
- **GraphQL Schema Update**: Enhanced schema to include creator field and Staff relationship
- **Auto-Assignment Logic**: Implemented automatic creator assignment based on user email matching
- **Authorization Validation**: Added validation to ensure creators are authorized (assigned to task or evaluator)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing API compatibility with optional creator field
- **Field Resolvers**: Added GraphQL field resolvers for creator Staff relationships

#### New Features Added:
- **Creator Auto-Assignment**: Automatically assigns creator when logged-in user email matches eligible staff
- **Authorization Validation**: Validates that creator is either assigned to task or is the evaluator
- **GraphQL Relationships**: Added creator field with Staff relationship in GraphQL schema
- **Optional Override**: Allows explicit creator assignment with validation

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Missing Creator Tracking**: Reports now properly track who created them
- **Authorization Gap**: Ensures only authorized staff can be set as creators

#### Improvements Made:
- **User Experience**: Seamless creator assignment without manual selection in most cases
- **Data Integrity**: Enforced business rules for report creator assignment
- **API Enhancement**: Extended GraphQL mutations to support optional creator parameter

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Interfaces:**
- `TaskStatusReport`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field
- `TaskProgress`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field
- `CreateTaskStatusReportInput`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field
- `CreateTaskProgressInput`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field

**GraphQL Schema Changes:**
```diff
type TaskStatusReport {
  id: ID!
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  statusSummary: String
+ creatorId: ID
  task: Task!
+ creator: Staff
}

type TaskProgress {
  id: ID!
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  progressPercent: Int!
  notes: String
+ creatorId: ID
  task: Task!
+ creator: Staff
}

// Mutation input updates
createTaskStatusReport(
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  statusSummary: String
+ creatorId: ID
): TaskStatusReport!

createTaskProgress(
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  progressPercent: Int!
  notes: String
+ creatorId: ID
): TaskProgress!
```

**Service Layer Enhancements:**
- Enhanced `TaskProgressService.createTaskProgress()` to accept `userEmail` parameter
- Enhanced `TaskStatusReportService.createTaskStatusReport()` to accept `userEmail` parameter
- Added creator auto-assignment logic based on user email matching
- Added authorization validation for explicit creator assignments

**Resolver Updates:**
- Updated task resolvers to pass user email to services for auto-assignment
- Added field resolvers for creator Staff relationships

**Creator Assignment Logic:**
1. If no explicit creator provided, check if user email matches any staff
2. If match found, validate staff is assigned to task OR is evaluator
3. If valid, auto-assign as creator
4. If explicit creator provided, validate they are authorized
5. Allow creation without creator if no valid assignment possible

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated interface documentation to describe creator fields
- Added JSDoc comments for new service method parameters
- Enhanced GraphQL schema documentation for creator relationships

#### Tests Added:
- **Creator Auto-Assignment Tests**: 8 new test cases for TaskProgressService
- **Creator Validation Tests**: 8 new test cases for TaskStatusReportService
- **Authorization Tests**: Tests for valid and invalid creator assignments
- **Edge Case Tests**: Tests for scenarios without user email or explicit creator

#### Test Coverage:
- All existing tests continue to pass (381 total tests)
- 16 new tests added specifically for creator functionality
- 100% coverage of new creator assignment logic paths

#### Potential Issues or Risks Identified:
- **Migration**: Existing reports will have `creatorId` as `undefined` - this is expected and handled
- **Performance**: Field resolvers add database lookups for creator - minimal impact expected
- **API Changes**: New optional fields are backward compatible

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding creator tracking to project status reports if needed
- Monitor performance of creator field resolver queries
- Consider adding creator audit trail for report modifications

### 2025-06-16 - GraphQL Resolver Refactoring: Organization and Department Module Extraction

#### Root Cause Analysis:
Organization and department queries, mutations, and field resolvers were mixed into the main query and mutation resolver files (`query.resolvers.ts` and `mutation.resolvers.ts`). This created large, monolithic resolver files that handled multiple distinct business domains, violating separation of concerns. The mixed responsibilities made it harder to maintain organization and department functionality independently and reduced code modularity.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Dedicated Organization Module**: Complete extraction of all organization-related GraphQL operations
- **Dedicated Department Module**: Complete extraction of all department-related GraphQL operations  
- **Enhanced Separation of Concerns**: Organization, department, and core business logic are now completely separated
- **Improved Maintainability**: Organization and department functionality can be modified independently
- **Better Code Organization**: Clear, logical separation between different business domains
- **Optimized Service Dependencies**: Each module only depends on the services it actually needs

#### New Features Added:
- **Complete Organization Module** (`organization.resolvers.ts`):
  - Organization queries: `organizations`, `organization` resolvers
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation and error handling

- **Complete Department Module** (`department.resolvers.ts`):
  - Department queries: `departments`, `department` resolvers  
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation and error handling

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Complete separation of organization and department logic from core resolvers
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine all resolver modules
- **Documentation**: Updated comments and file descriptions to reflect new responsibilities  
- **Service Initialization**: Proper organization and department service setup with correct dependencies
- **Clean Dependencies**: Removed unused organization and department imports from query/mutation resolvers
- **Field Resolver Distribution**: Staff organization and department field resolvers moved to appropriate modules

#### Technical Implementation:
- Extracted all organization queries, mutations, and field resolvers from core resolver files to `organization.resolvers.ts`
- Extracted all department queries, mutations, and field resolvers from core resolver files to `department.resolvers.ts`
- Removed organization and department field resolvers from `staffResolvers` in `query.resolvers.ts`
- Updated resolver index to merge in new organization and department resolvers
- Enhanced service initialization to call organization and department initializers with correct dependencies
- Cleaned up imports and service variable declarations in affected files
- Maintained existing GraphQL API interface - no breaking changes

#### Complete Resolver Architecture Achieved:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): authentication queries + authentication mutations  
3. **User Management** (`user.resolvers.ts`): user queries + user mutations
4. **Organization Management** (`organization.resolvers.ts`): organization queries + mutations + field resolvers
5. **Department Management** (`department.resolvers.ts`): department queries + mutations + field resolvers
6. **Core Business Logic** (`query.resolvers.ts`): staff, teams, projects, tasks, etc.
7. **Core Business Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): CRUD operations for core business entities

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing organization and department tests continue to pass without modification:
  - `organization-crud.test.ts` (15 tests) - Complete organization CRUD operations
  - `projects-tasks-crud.test.ts` - Integration tests including organization/department setup
- Full test suite passes: **29 test suites, 365 tests passed**

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- None identified - refactoring is complete and all tests pass

#### Potential Issues/Risks:
- None identified - all existing functionality preserved with improved organization

### 2025-06-16 - Complete Authentication Module Extraction and Resolver Architecture Finalization

#### Root Cause Analysis:
Authentication mutations (register, login, changePassword, logout, refreshToken) were mixed into the main mutation resolvers module (`mutation.resolvers.ts`) alongside business entity mutations. This created a monolithic mutation resolver that handled both authentication operations and business logic operations, violating separation of concerns. The mixed responsibilities made it harder to maintain authentication functionality independently and reduced code modularity.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Complete Authentication Module**: Now have a fully dedicated authentication module handling both queries and mutations
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Authentication, system monitoring, and business logic are completely separated
- **Improved Maintainability**: All authentication-related code can be modified independently
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Clear, logical separation between different types of operations
- **Better Service Dependencies**: Each module only depends on the services it actually needs

#### New Features Added:
- **Complete Authentication Module** (`auth.resolvers.ts`):
  - Authentication queries: `me` resolver for current user information
  - Follows established resolver patterns

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Complete separation of authentication from business mutations
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine all resolver modules
- **Documentation**: Updated comments and file descriptions to reflect new responsibilities
- **Service Initialization**: Proper auth service setup with both user and auth services
- **Clean Dependencies**: Removed unused authentication imports from mutation resolvers

#### Technical Implementation:
- Moved all authentication mutations from `/be/src/resolvers/mutation.resolvers.ts` to `/be/src/resolvers/auth.resolvers.ts`
- Added `authMutationResolvers` export containing all authentication mutations
- Updated resolver index to combine auth mutations with other mutations
- Enhanced auth service initialization to include AuthService
- Removed unused imports (LoginInput, ChangePasswordInput) from mutation resolvers
- Updated file-level documentation across all affected modules
- Maintained existing API interface - no breaking changes

#### Complete Resolver Architecture Achieved:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): authentication queries + authentication mutations
3. **Business Logic** (`query.resolvers.ts`): users, organizations, projects, tasks, etc.
4. **Business Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): CRUD operations for business entities

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing authentication tests continue to pass without modification:
  - `auth.test.ts` (1 test) - Complete authentication flow
  - `user-crud.test.ts` (2 tests) - Business mutations still work correctly
- Authentication functionality verified through comprehensive test suite
- No breaking changes to existing GraphQL API
- Confirmed no errors in TypeScript compilation

### 2025-06-16 - Authentication Resolver Extraction and Complete Resolver Modularization (Previous Entry)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The "me" resolver was mixed into the main query resolvers module (`query.resolvers.ts`) alongside business data queries. This violated the separation of concerns principle as authentication-related queries (current user information) were bundled with business entity queries (users, organizations, etc.). The monolithic approach reduced code modularity and made it harder to maintain authentication functionality independently from business logic.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Complete Resolver Modularization**: Now have dedicated modules for different concerns:
  - `health.resolvers.ts` - System monitoring (health checks + configuration)
  - `query.resolvers.ts` - Pure business data queries
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Authentication logic is now isolated from business query logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Authentication functionality can be modified independently
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Clear separation between system, auth, and business concerns

#### New Features Added:
- **Dedicated Authentication Resolver Module** (`auth.resolvers.ts`):
  - Isolated "me" resolver for current user information
  - Follows established resolver patterns

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted authentication queries into dedicated module
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine auth, health, and query resolvers
- **Documentation**: Updated comments to reflect the new modular structure
- **Service Initialization**: Added dedicated auth service setup in initialization process
- **Clear Separation**: Now have distinct modules for system monitoring, authentication, and business logic

#### Technical Implementation:
- Created `/be/src/resolvers/auth.resolvers.ts` with "me" resolver
- Removed "me" resolver from `/be/src/resolvers/query.resolvers.ts`
- Updated `/be/src/resolvers/index.ts` to import and combine auth resolvers
- Added auth service initialization to the initialization process
- Maintained existing API interface - no breaking changes

#### Complete Resolver Architecture:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): current user information and auth status
3. **Business Logic** (`query.resolvers.ts`): users, organizations, projects, tasks, etc.
4. **Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): all write operations

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing "me" query tests continue to pass without modification (2 tests)
- All health and config tests continue to pass (6 test suites, 16 tests total)
- Authentication functionality verified through `me-query.test.ts`
- No breaking changes to existing GraphQL API
- Confirmed no errors in TypeScript compilation

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated file-level documentation in affected modules
- Enhanced JSDoc comments for new auth resolver module
- Updated WORKLOG.md with comprehensive change summary

### 2025-06-16 - Health Check and Configuration Resolver Modularization (Previous Entry)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
Both the health check and configuration resolvers were mixed into the main query resolvers module (`query.resolvers.ts`), violating the separation of concerns principle. This made the query resolver module responsible for business logic queries (users, organizations), infrastructure monitoring (health checks), and system configuration access. The monolithic approach reduced code modularity and made it harder to maintain system monitoring functionality independently.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: System monitoring logic (health + config) is now isolated from business query logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Health and configuration functionality can be modified independently without affecting business queries
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Following the established pattern of modular resolver structure
- **Logical Grouping**: Health checks and configuration access both relate to system monitoring and status

#### New Features Added:
- **Unified System Monitoring Module** (`health.resolvers.ts`):
  - Combined health check and configuration access resolvers
  - Follows established resolver patterns

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted system monitoring into its own dedicated module
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine health/config and query resolvers
- **Documentation**: Updated comments to reflect the new modular structure
- **Service Initialization**: Health service setup handles both health and config functionality
- **Cleaner Dependencies**: Removed unused config import from query resolvers

#### Technical Implementation:
- Moved config resolver from `/be/src/resolvers/query.resolvers.ts` to `/be/src/resolvers/health.resolvers.ts`
- Added config import to health.resolvers.ts for configuration access
- Removed unused config import from query.resolvers.ts
- Updated file-level documentation to reflect new responsibilities
- Maintained existing API interface - no breaking changes

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing config tests continue to pass without modification (3 test suites, 13 tests)
- All existing health tests continue to pass without modification
- Configuration access functionality verified through `config.test.ts`
- Health check functionality verified through `health.test.ts`
- No breaking changes to existing GraphQL API
- Confirmed no errors in TypeScript compilation

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated file-level documentation in affected modules
- Enhanced JSDoc comments for health resolver module to include configuration access
- Updated WORKLOG.md with comprehensive change summary

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The health check resolver was mixed into the main query resolvers module (`query.resolvers.ts`), violating the separation of concerns principle. This made the query resolver module responsible for both business logic queries (users, organizations, config) and infrastructure monitoring (health checks). The monolithic approach reduced code modularity and made it harder to maintain health-related functionality independently.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Health monitoring logic is now isolated from business query logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Health check functionality can be modified independently without affecting business queries
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Following the established pattern of modular resolver structure
- **Cleaner Dependencies**: Health check only requires minimal dependencies (logger and userService for status verification)

#### New Features Added:
- **Dedicated Health Resolver Module** (`health.resolvers.ts`):
  - Isolated health check resolver logic
  - Follows established resolver patterns

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted health check into its own dedicated module
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine health and query resolvers
