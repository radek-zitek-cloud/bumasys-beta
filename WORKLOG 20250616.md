## Change Log for June 16, 2025

### 2025-06-16 - Task Status Report and Progress Report Creator Staff Implementation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The system required modification of Task Status Report and Progress Report entities to include a creator Staff field. When these reports are created, a report creator needs to be set who is one of the Staff assigned to the Task or the evaluator of the Task. The requirement was to auto-detect the creator when the logged-in user's email matches one of the eligible staff members.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Data Model Enhancement**: Added `creatorId` field to both TaskStatusReport and TaskProgress interfaces
- **GraphQL Schema Update**: Enhanced schema to include creator field and Staff relationship
- **Auto-Assignment Logic**: Implemented automatic creator assignment based on user email matching
- **Authorization Validation**: Added validation to ensure creators are authorized (assigned to task or evaluator)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing API compatibility with optional creator field
- **Field Resolvers**: Added GraphQL field resolvers for creator Staff relationships

#### New Features Added:
- **Creator Auto-Assignment**: Automatically assigns creator when logged-in user email matches eligible staff
- **Authorization Validation**: Validates that creator is either assigned to task or is the evaluator
- **GraphQL Relationships**: Added creator field with Staff relationship in GraphQL schema
- **Optional Override**: Allows explicit creator assignment with validation

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Missing Creator Tracking**: Reports now properly track who created them
- **Authorization Gap**: Ensures only authorized staff can be set as creators

#### Improvements Made:
- **User Experience**: Seamless creator assignment without manual selection in most cases
- **Data Integrity**: Enforced business rules for report creator assignment
- **API Enhancement**: Extended GraphQL mutations to support optional creator parameter

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Interfaces:**
- `TaskStatusReport`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field
- `TaskProgress`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field
- `CreateTaskStatusReportInput`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field
- `CreateTaskProgressInput`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field

**GraphQL Schema Changes:**
```diff
type TaskStatusReport {
  id: ID!
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  statusSummary: String
+ creatorId: ID
  task: Task!
+ creator: Staff
}

type TaskProgress {
  id: ID!
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  progressPercent: Int!
  notes: String
+ creatorId: ID
  task: Task!
+ creator: Staff
}

// Mutation input updates
createTaskStatusReport(
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  statusSummary: String
+ creatorId: ID
): TaskStatusReport!

createTaskProgress(
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  progressPercent: Int!
  notes: String
+ creatorId: ID
): TaskProgress!
```

**Service Layer Enhancements:**
- Enhanced `TaskProgressService.createTaskProgress()` to accept `userEmail` parameter
- Enhanced `TaskStatusReportService.createTaskStatusReport()` to accept `userEmail` parameter
- Added creator auto-assignment logic based on user email matching
- Added authorization validation for explicit creator assignments

**Resolver Updates:**
- Updated task resolvers to pass user email to services for auto-assignment
- Added field resolvers for creator Staff relationships

**Creator Assignment Logic:**
1. If no explicit creator provided, check if user email matches any staff
2. If match found, validate staff is assigned to task OR is evaluator
3. If valid, auto-assign as creator
4. If explicit creator provided, validate they are authorized
5. Allow creation without creator if no valid assignment possible

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated interface documentation to describe creator fields
- Added JSDoc comments for new service method parameters
- Enhanced GraphQL schema documentation for creator relationships

#### Tests Added:
- **Creator Auto-Assignment Tests**: 8 new test cases for TaskProgressService
- **Creator Validation Tests**: 8 new test cases for TaskStatusReportService
- **Authorization Tests**: Tests for valid and invalid creator assignments
- **Edge Case Tests**: Tests for scenarios without user email or explicit creator

#### Test Coverage:
- All existing tests continue to pass (381 total tests)
- 16 new tests added specifically for creator functionality
- 100% coverage of new creator assignment logic paths

#### Potential Issues or Risks Identified:
- **Migration**: Existing reports will have `creatorId` as `undefined` - this is expected and handled
- **Performance**: Field resolvers add database lookups for creator - minimal impact expected
- **API Changes**: New optional fields are backward compatible

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding creator tracking to project status reports if needed
- Monitor performance of creator field resolver queries
- Consider adding creator audit trail for report modifications

### 2025-06-16 - GraphQL Resolver Refactoring: Organization and Department Module Extraction

#### Root Cause Analysis:
Organization and department queries, mutations, and field resolvers were mixed into the main query and mutation resolver files (`query.resolvers.ts` and `mutation.resolvers.ts`). This created large, monolithic resolver files that handled multiple distinct business domains, violating separation of concerns. The mixed responsibilities made it harder to maintain organization and department functionality independently and reduced code modularity.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Dedicated Organization Module**: Complete extraction of all organization-related GraphQL operations
- **Dedicated Department Module**: Complete extraction of all department-related GraphQL operations  
- **Enhanced Separation of Concerns**: Organization, department, and core business logic are now completely separated
- **Improved Maintainability**: Organization and department functionality can be modified independently
- **Better Code Organization**: Clear, logical separation between different business domains
- **Optimized Service Dependencies**: Each module only depends on the services it actually needs

#### New Features Added:
- **Complete Organization Module** (`organization.resolvers.ts`):
  - Organization queries: `organizations`, `organization` resolvers
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation and error handling

- **Complete Department Module** (`department.resolvers.ts`):
  - Department queries: `departments`, `department` resolvers  
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation and error handling

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Complete separation of organization and department logic from core resolvers
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine all resolver modules
- **Documentation**: Updated comments and file descriptions to reflect new responsibilities  
- **Service Initialization**: Proper organization and department service setup with correct dependencies
- **Clean Dependencies**: Removed unused organization and department imports from query/mutation resolvers
- **Field Resolver Distribution**: Staff organization and department field resolvers moved to appropriate modules

#### Technical Implementation:
- Extracted all organization queries, mutations, and field resolvers from core resolver files to `organization.resolvers.ts`
- Extracted all department queries, mutations, and field resolvers from core resolver files to `department.resolvers.ts`
- Removed organization and department field resolvers from `staffResolvers` in `query.resolvers.ts`
- Updated resolver index to merge in new organization and department resolvers
- Enhanced service initialization to call organization and department initializers with correct dependencies
- Cleaned up imports and service variable declarations in affected files
- Maintained existing GraphQL API interface - no breaking changes

#### Complete Resolver Architecture Achieved:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): authentication queries + authentication mutations
3. **User Management** (`user.resolvers.ts`): user queries + user mutations
4. **Organization Management** (`organization.resolvers.ts`): organization queries + mutations + field resolvers
5. **Department Management** (`department.resolvers.ts`): department queries + mutations + field resolvers
6. **Core Business Logic** (`query.resolvers.ts`): staff, teams, projects, tasks, etc.
7. **Core Business Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): CRUD operations for core business entities

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing organization and department tests continue to pass without modification:
  - `organization-crud.test.ts` (15 tests) - Complete organization CRUD operations
  - `projects-tasks-crud.test.ts` - Integration tests including organization/department setup
- Full test suite passes: **29 test suites, 365 tests passed**

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- None identified - refactoring is complete and all tests pass

#### Potential Issues/Risks:
- None identified - all existing functionality preserved with improved organization

### 2025-06-16 - Complete Authentication Module Extraction and Resolver Architecture Finalization

#### Root Cause Analysis:
Authentication mutations (register, login, changePassword, logout, refreshToken) were mixed into the main mutation resolvers module (`mutation.resolvers.ts`) alongside business entity mutations. This created a monolithic mutation resolver that handled both authentication operations and business logic operations, violating separation of concerns. The mixed responsibilities made it harder to maintain authentication functionality independently and reduced code modularity.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Complete Authentication Module**: Now have a fully dedicated authentication module handling both queries and mutations
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Authentication, system monitoring, and business logic are completely separated
- **Improved Maintainability**: All authentication-related code can be modified independently
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Clear, logical separation between different types of operations
- **Better Service Dependencies**: Each module only depends on the services it actually needs

#### New Features Added:
- **Complete Authentication Module** (`auth.resolvers.ts`):
  - Authentication queries: `me` resolver for current user information
  - Follows established resolver patterns

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Complete separation of authentication from business mutations
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine all resolver modules
- **Documentation**: Updated comments and file descriptions to reflect new responsibilities
- **Service Initialization**: Proper auth service setup with both user and auth services

#### Technical Implementation:
- Moved all authentication mutations from `/be/src/resolvers/mutation.resolvers.ts` to `/be/src/resolvers/auth.resolvers.ts`
- Added `authMutationResolvers` export containing all authentication mutations
- Updated resolver index to combine auth mutations with other mutations
- Enhanced auth service initialization to include AuthService
- Removed unused imports (LoginInput, ChangePasswordInput) from mutation resolvers
- Updated file-level documentation across all affected modules
- Maintained existing API interface - no breaking changes

#### Complete Resolver Architecture Achieved:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): authentication queries + authentication mutations
3. **Business Logic** (`query.resolvers.ts`): users, organizations, projects, tasks, etc.
4. **Business Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): CRUD operations for business entities

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing authentication tests continue to pass without modification:
  - `auth.test.ts` (1 test) - Complete authentication flow
  - `user-crud.test.ts` (2 tests) - Business mutations still work correctly
- Authentication functionality verified through comprehensive test suite
- No breaking changes to existing GraphQL API
- Confirmed no errors in TypeScript compilation

### 2025-06-16 - Authentication Resolver Extraction and Complete Resolver Modularization (Previous Entry)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The "me" resolver was mixed into the main query resolvers module (`query.resolvers.ts`) alongside business data queries. This violated the separation of concerns principle as authentication-related queries (current user information) were bundled with business entity queries (users, organizations, etc.). The monolithic approach reduced code modularity and made it harder to maintain authentication functionality independently from business logic.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Complete Resolver Modularization**: Now have dedicated modules for different concerns:
  - `health.resolvers.ts` - System monitoring (health checks + configuration)
  - `query.resolvers.ts` - Pure business data queries
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Authentication logic is now isolated from business query logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Authentication functionality can be modified independently
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Clear separation between system, auth, and business concerns

#### New Features Added:
- **Dedicated Authentication Resolver Module** (`auth.resolvers.ts`):
  - Isolated "me" resolver for current user information
  - Follows established resolver patterns

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted authentication queries into dedicated module
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine auth, health, and query resolvers
- **Documentation**: Updated comments to reflect the new modular structure
- **Service Initialization**: Added dedicated auth service setup in initialization process
- **Clear Separation**: Now have distinct modules for system monitoring, authentication, and business logic

#### Technical Implementation:
- Created `/be/src/resolvers/auth.resolvers.ts` with "me" resolver
- Removed "me" resolver from `/be/src/resolvers/query.resolvers.ts`
- Updated `/be/src/resolvers/index.ts` to import and combine auth resolvers
- Added auth service initialization to the initialization process
- Maintained existing API interface - no breaking changes

#### Complete Resolver Architecture:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): current user information and auth status
3. **Business Logic** (`query.resolvers.ts`): users, organizations, projects, tasks, etc.
4. **Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): all write operations

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing "me" query tests continue to pass without modification (2 tests)
- All health and config tests continue to pass (6 test suites, 16 tests total)
- Authentication functionality verified through `me-query.test.ts`
- No breaking changes to existing GraphQL API
- Confirmed no errors in TypeScript compilation

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated file-level documentation in affected modules
- Enhanced JSDoc comments for new auth resolver module

### 2025-06-16 - Health Check and Configuration Resolver Modularization (Previous Entry)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
Both the health check and configuration resolvers were mixed into the main query resolvers module (`query.resolvers.ts`), violating the separation of concerns principle. This made the query resolver module responsible for business logic queries (users, organizations), infrastructure monitoring (health checks), and system configuration access. The monolithic approach reduced code modularity and made it harder to maintain system monitoring functionality independently.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: System monitoring logic (health + config) is now isolated from business query logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Health and configuration functionality can be modified independently without affecting business queries
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Following the established pattern of modular resolver structure
- **Logical Grouping**: Health checks and configuration access both relate to system monitoring and status

#### New Features Added:
- **Unified System Monitoring Module** (`health.resolvers.ts`):
  - Combined health check and configuration access resolvers
  - Follows established resolver patterns

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted system monitoring into its own dedicated module
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine health/config and query resolvers
- **Documentation**: Updated comments to reflect the new modular structure
- **Service Initialization**: Health service setup handles both health and config functionality
- **Cleaner Dependencies**: Removed unused config import from query resolvers

#### Technical Implementation:
- Moved config resolver from `/be/src/resolvers/query.resolvers.ts` to `/be/src/resolvers/health.resolvers.ts`
- Added config import to health.resolvers.ts for configuration access
- Removed unused config import from query.resolvers.ts
- Updated file-level documentation to reflect new responsibilities
- Maintained existing API interface - no breaking changes

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing config tests continue to pass without modification (3 test suites, 13 tests)
- All existing health tests continue to pass without modification
- Configuration access functionality verified through `config.test.ts`
- Health check functionality verified through `health.test.ts`
- No breaking changes to existing GraphQL API
- Confirmed no errors in TypeScript compilation

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated file-level documentation in affected modules
- Enhanced JSDoc comments for health resolver module to include configuration access
- Updated WORKLOG.md with comprehensive change summary

### 2025-06-16 - Health Check Resolver Modularization (Previous Entry)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The health check resolver was mixed into the main query resolvers module (`query.resolvers.ts`), violating the separation of concerns principle. This made the query resolver module responsible for both business logic queries (users, organizations, config) and infrastructure monitoring (health checks). The monolithic approach reduced code modularity and made it harder to maintain health-related functionality independently.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Health monitoring logic is now isolated from business query logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Health check functionality can be modified independently without affecting business queries
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Following the established pattern of modular resolver structure
- **Cleaner Dependencies**: Health check only requires minimal dependencies (logger and userService for status verification)

#### New Features Added:
- **Dedicated Health Resolver Module** (`health.resolvers.ts`):
  - Isolated health check resolver logic
  - Follows established resolver patterns

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted health check into its own dedicated module
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine health and query resolvers

### 2025-06-16 - Task Graph Nesting Implementation with Vue Flow Parent-Child Relationships

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The task graph visualization system had a fundamental design issue where tasks were displayed as separate, independent nodes rather than being properly nested inside their project containers. This made it difficult to understand project structure and task relationships at a glance.

Key issues identified:
1. **No True Nesting**: Tasks appeared near but not inside project nodes
2. **Poor Visual Hierarchy**: Project-task relationships were unclear
3. **Missing Container Semantics**: Project nodes didn't act as proper containers
4. **Scattered Layout**: Tasks from same project could appear anywhere on the graph

#### Impact of Changes:
- **True Hierarchical Visualization**: Tasks are now nested inside their project containers
- **Improved User Understanding**: Clear visual representation of project-task relationships
- **Better Organization**: Tasks grouped by project with proper container boundaries
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Users can easily identify which tasks belong to which projects
- **Multi-Project Support**: Handles complex scenarios with tasks spanning multiple projects

#### New Features Added:
- **Parent-Child Node Relationships**: Implemented Vue Flow `parentNode` property for proper nesting
- **Project Container Nodes**: Project nodes act as true containers with headers and content areas
- **Task Grouping Logic**: Algorithm to group all related tasks by their project
- **Connection Handle System**: Proper Vue Flow handles for all connection directions
- **Multi-Project Layout**: Horizontal layout for multiple project containers
- **Relative Positioning**: Task positions calculated relative to their parent project

#### Technical Implementation:

**Vue Flow Integration:**
- Implemented `parentNode: projectId` for child task nodes
- Added `extent: 'parent'` to constrain task movement within projects
- Used `Position` enum for proper handle positioning (Left, Right, Top, Bottom)
- Imported `Handle` component for connection points on all task nodes

**Core Algorithm Changes:**
```typescript
// Group all tasks by project
const tasksByProject = new Map()
for (const task of allTasks) {
  const projectId = task.project?.id || 'unknown'
  if (!tasksByProject.has(projectId)) {
    tasksByProject.set(projectId, { project, tasks: [] })
  }
  tasksByProject.get(projectId).tasks.push(task)
}

// Create project containers and nested task nodes
for (const [projectId, { project, tasks }] of tasksByProject.entries()) {
  // Project container node
  nodes.push({
    id: `project-${projectId}`,
    type: 'project',
    style: { width: projectWidth, height: projectHeight }
  })
  
  // Nested task nodes
  for (const task of tasks) {
    nodes.push({
      id: task.id,
      parentNode: `project-${projectId}`,
      extent: 'parent',
      position: { x: relativeX, y: relativeY }
    })
  }
}
```

**UI Component Enhancements:**
- **Project Container Template**: New container design with header and content sections
- **Handle Integration**: Added Vue Flow handles to all task node templates
- **Container Styling**: Purple gradient containers with proper headers
- **Task Node Updates**: Enhanced with connection handles for all directions
- **Responsive Layout**: Dynamic container sizing based on contained tasks

**Edge Connection Preservation:**
- Maintained predecessor→current task connections (right handle → left handle)
- Preserved current task→child task connections (bottom handle → top handle)
- Edge styling and behavior unchanged from previous implementation

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue` - Complete nesting implementation
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskGraphDialog.test.ts` - Fixed merge conflicts and enhanced tests
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskGraphNesting.test.ts` - New comprehensive nesting tests

#### Testing Results:
- **11/11 tests passing** (7 existing + 4 new nesting tests)
- **Type checking successful** with proper Vue Flow type imports
- **Logic verification** for task grouping and parent-child relationships
- **Edge connection testing** to ensure proper handle connections

#### Documentation Updates:
- Enhanced component documentation to reflect nesting capabilities
- Added technical notes about Vue Flow parent-child relationships
- Documented the task grouping algorithm and positioning logic

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding node interaction features (click to navigate to task/project)
- Potential enhancement: resize handles for project containers
- Future consideration: expand to show multi-level task hierarchies
- Performance optimization for large numbers of tasks per project

#### Potential Risks Identified:
- Large numbers of tasks in single project might need layout optimization
- Very wide project names could affect container sizing
- Future Vue Flow version compatibility considerations
- Performance considerations for complex multi-project hierarchies

### 2025-06-16 - Enhanced Progress and Status Report Lists UI

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The progress reports and status reports lists in the task management page needed better visual hierarchy, improved information display, and more modern design patterns. The original lists had minimal styling and didn't make optimal use of available space or provide clear visual separation between different types of information.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Better spacing, typography, and layout structure
- **Enhanced Information Display**: More prominent creator information using chips
- **Better UX**: Clearer visual separation between reports and improved readability

- Creator information in outlined primary chip with account icon
- Progress percentage in success-colored chip with trending-up icon
- Better spacing and padding throughout

**Status Reports List:**
- Larger info-colored avatar with flag icon
- Report title shows "Status Report from [date]" for clarity
- Status summary with proper text emphasis
- Creator information in outlined primary chip
- Report date in info-colored chip with calendar-clock icon
- Consistent styling with progress reports

#### Technical Implementation:
- Enhanced list styling with `pa-0` class for better control
- Added `py-3` padding and `border-b` for visual separation
- Improved `flex-grow-1` layout for better space utilization
- Used `v-chip` components for better information hierarchy
- Added color coding: primary for creators, success for progress, info for dates
- Maintained existing functionality while improving visual presentation

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue` - Enhanced both progress and status report list layouts

#### Design Improvements:
- **Better Visual Weight**: Larger avatars and improved spacing create better visual balance
- **Information Hierarchy**: Primary information (title) is more prominent, secondary info (chips) is clearly grouped
- **Consistent Patterns**: Both lists follow the same design patterns for consistency
- **Accessibility**: Better contrast and visual separation for improved readability
- **Responsive Design**: Chips wrap gracefully on smaller screens with `flex-wrap`

### 2025-01-16 - Creator Display in Task Report Lists (Completed Issue #104)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Task Details page was missing creator information in the lists of status reports and progress reports. While the creator functionality was fully implemented in the backend and creation dialogs (as part of issue #102), the report lists only displayed date and content (summary/notes) without showing who created each report. Users needed visibility into report authorship for better accountability and traceability.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Report lists now display creator information alongside existing content
- **Improved Accountability**: Users can easily identify who created each report
- **Consistent Information Architecture**: Creator information follows established design patterns
- **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful handling of existing reports without creator information
- **Minimal UI Changes**: Non-disruptive integration that maintains existing layouts

#### New Features Added:
- **Creator Display in Progress Reports**: Shows "Creator: FirstName LastName" with account icon
- **Creator Display in Status Reports**: Shows "Creator: FirstName LastName" with account icon  
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only displays creator information when available
- **GraphQL Data Enhancement**: Extended query to fetch creator staff details

#### Technical Implementation:

**GraphQL Query Enhancement:**
- Enhanced `getTaskWithManagementData` query in `fe/src/services/tasks.ts`
- Added `creatorId` and `creator` fields to both report types
- Included staff details: id, firstName, lastName, email

**UI Component Updates:**
- Modified report list items in `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue`
- Added creator information as small caption text below main content
- Used conditional rendering with `v-if="report.creator"`
- Maintained existing prepend/append action button layouts

#### Code Quality:
- **Minimal Changes**: Only 2 files modified with targeted enhancements
- **Consistent Styling**: Used existing Vuetify design tokens and patterns
- **Type Safety**: Leveraged existing TypeScript interfaces
- **Linting Compliance**: All changes pass ESLint validation
- **Test Coverage**: Existing test suite continues to pass

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/services/tasks.ts` - Enhanced GraphQL query for creator data
- `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue` - Added creator display in both report lists

#### User Experience Impact:
- **Seamless Integration**: Creator information appears naturally in existing lists
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Creator shown as subtle caption text that doesn't compete with primary content
- **Icon Context**: Account icon provides visual cue for creator information
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality and workflows remain unchanged

This implementation successfully addresses the requirement to display creator information in task report lists while maintaining design consistency and user experience quality. The changes are surgical and focused, adding value without disrupting existing workflows.

### 2025-06-16 - UI Creator Field Implementation for Task Reports (Completed Issue #102)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The backend creator field functionality was already implemented, but the UI components lacked the necessary fields for manual creator selection. Users needed a way to select the report creator from eligible staff members (those assigned to the task or the evaluator) with automatic preset based on their email.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Added intuitive creator selection dropdowns in report creation dialogs
- **Smart Auto-Assignment**: Automatically presets creator when user email matches eligible staff
- **Manual Override Capability**: Users can manually select a different eligible creator
- **Consistent UI Patterns**: Follows established dialog component design patterns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interface definitions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests validate all creator field functionality

#### Technical Implementation:

**Frontend Interface Updates:**
- Enhanced `CreateTaskStatusReportInput` and `CreateTaskProgressInput` to include `creatorId?: string`
- Updated `TaskStatusReport` and `TaskProgress` interfaces to include creator information
- Modified GraphQL mutations to pass `creatorId` parameter to backend

**UI Component Enhancements:**
```vue
<!-- Creator Selection Dropdown -->
<v-select
  v-model="form.creatorId"
  clearable
  item-title="displayName"
  item-value="id"
  :items="staffOptions"
  label="Creator"
  prepend-icon="mdi-account-supervisor"
  variant="outlined"
/>
```

**Eligible Staff Logic:**
- Created computed property to identify eligible staff (assignees + evaluator)
- Prevents duplicate entries when evaluator is also assigned to task
- Formats staff display as "FirstName LastName (email)" for clarity

**Auto-Preset Functionality:**
```typescript
function presetCreator() {
  if (!authStore.user?.email || !props.eligibleStaff) return
  
  const matchingStaff = props.eligibleStaff.find(staff => 
    staff.email.toLowerCase() === authStore.user?.email.toLowerCase()
  )
  
  if (matchingStaff) {
    form.creatorId = matchingStaff.id
  }
}
```

**Component Props Enhancement:**
- Added `eligibleStaff?: Staff[]` prop to both dialog components
- Updated task management page to pass eligible staff data
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing usage

#### New Features Added:
- **Manual Creator Selection**: Dropdown allowing selection from eligible staff members
- **Smart Auto-Preset**: Automatically selects creator when user email matches staff
- **Visual Guidance**: Helper text explaining creator selection rules
- **Eligible Staff Filtering**: Only shows staff assigned to task or evaluator
- **Email-Based Matching**: Case-insensitive email matching for auto-assignment

#### Code Quality Improvements:
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Created test suite validating all creator field functionality
- **Linting Compliance**: Fixed style issues in modified files
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or invalid creator data

#### Testing Coverage:
- Creator dropdown display validation
- Auto-preset logic based on user email matching
- Form submission with creator data inclusion
- Staff options formatting verification
- Edge cases for non-matching emails

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/services/tasks.ts` - Interface and GraphQL mutation updates
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskStatusReportCreateDialog.vue` - Creator field UI
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskProgressCreateDialog.vue` - Creator field UI  
- `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue` - Eligible staff logic and prop passing
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskStatusReportCreateDialog.creator.test.ts` - Unit tests

#### User Experience Impact:
- **Seamless Workflow**: Most users will have creator auto-selected based on their email
- **Flexibility**: Manual override available when needed
- **Clear Guidance**: Helper text explains selection criteria
- **Consistent Design**: Matches other form elements in the application

This implementation successfully bridges the gap between the existing backend creator functionality and the frontend user interface, providing an intuitive and user-friendly way to manage report creators while maintaining all business rules and validation logic.
