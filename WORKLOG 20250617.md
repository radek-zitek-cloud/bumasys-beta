### 2025-06-17 - Dynamic Project Sizing and Parent-Child Nesting Restoration

#### Improvements Made:
**Re-enabled Parent-Child Nesting:**
- Restored `parentNode` and `extent: 'parent'` properties for proper task nesting
- Tasks are now properly contained within their project nodes
- Maintained working edge connections with proper handle targeting

**Dynamic Project Node Sizing:**
- Implemented intelligent project container sizing based on number of contained tasks
- Projects now arrange tasks in a grid layout (roughly square) for optimal space usage
- Dynamic width/height calculation: `projectWidth = max(300, (tasksPerRow * taskWidth) + spacing + padding)`
- Projects automatically resize to fit all their tasks without overflow

**Grid Layout for Tasks Within Projects:**
- Tasks positioned in grid formation within project containers
- Calculated positioning: `taskX = padding + (col * (taskWidth + spacing))`
- Tasks arranged in rows and columns for clean organization
- Header space reserved for project title and metadata

**Improved Styling:**
- Fixed task node dimensions to consistent 200px width × 80px min-height
- Added `overflow: visible` to project content area for proper child visibility
- Consistent spacing and padding throughout the layout
- Project containers have minimum dimensions for proper display

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Dynamic sizing algorithm
const tasksInProject = tasks.length
const tasksPerRow = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(tasksInProject))
const projectWidth = Math.max(300, (tasksPerRow * taskWidth) + spacing + padding)
const projectHeight = Math.max(200, (rows * taskHeight) + spacing + padding + headerHeight)

// Grid positioning within project
const row = Math.floor(taskIndex / tasksPerRow)
const col = taskIndex % tasksPerRow
const taskX = projectPadding + (col * (taskWidth + taskSpacing))
const taskY = projectPadding + 60 + (row * (taskHeight + taskSpacing))
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Tasks properly nested inside project containers
- ✅ Project nodes dynamically resize to fit their content
- ✅ Clean grid layout for multiple tasks within projects
- ✅ Maintained proper edge connections (predecessor: right→left, child: bottom→top)
- ✅ Professional visual hierarchy and organization

### 2025-06-17 - Task Graph Edge Connection Fix

#### Bug Fixed:
Fixed incorrect edge connections in the task graph visualization where predecessor tasks were connecting to the wrong handle on the current task.

**Root Cause:**
- Predecessor task edges were using string values (`'right'`, `'left'`) instead of `Position` enum values
- This caused Vue Flow to default to connecting to the bottom handle instead of the left handle for the target

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated predecessor edge creation to use `Position.Right` for source handle and `Position.Left` for target handle
- Ensured consistent use of `Position` enum for all edge connections
- Child task edges also updated to use `Position.Bottom` and `Position.Top` for consistency

**Impact:**
- Predecessor tasks now correctly connect from their right handle to the current task's left handle
- Visual flow now properly represents the logical task dependency direction (left to right)
- Improved graph readability and intuitive understanding of task relationships

**Files Modified:**
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue`: Fixed edge handle positioning

**Troubleshooting Edge Connection Issue:**
- Added unique IDs to all Handle components (`id="left"`, `id="right"`, `id="top"`, `id="bottom"`)
- Temporarily disabled parent-child nesting to isolate edge connection issue
- Adjusted absolute positioning to place tasks outside project containers
- This will help determine if the issue is with edge targeting or parent-child positioning

**Next Steps:**
- Test edge connections with simplified layout
- Re-enable parent-child nesting once edge connections are confirmed working

### Project Node Transparency Update:
- Changed project container background from gradient to transparent
- Updated text color from white to dark purple (#4A148C) for better readability
- Made project content area fully transparent
- Updated project header border to use semi-transparent dark purple
- Added explicit icon color override to maintain visibility
- Maintained border and shadow for visual definition without background fill

**Visual Impact:**
- Project containers now act as transparent frames around task groups
- Better integration with overall graph background
- Cleaner, less cluttered appearance
- Task nodes remain fully visible and prominent within their project boundaries
