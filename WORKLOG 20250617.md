## Change Log for June 17, 2025

### 2025-06-17 - Dynamic Project Sizing and Parent-Child Nesting Restoration

#### Improvements Made:
**Re-enabled Parent-Child Nesting:**
- Restored `parentNode` and `extent: 'parent'` properties for proper task nesting
- Tasks are now properly contained within their project nodes
- Maintained working edge connections with proper handle targeting

**Dynamic Project Node Sizing:**
- Implemented intelligent project container sizing based on number of contained tasks
- Projects now arrange tasks in a grid layout (roughly square) for optimal space usage
- Dynamic width/height calculation: `projectWidth = max(300, (tasksPerRow * taskWidth) + spacing + padding)`
- Projects automatically resize to fit all their tasks without overflow

**Grid Layout for Tasks Within Projects:**
- Tasks positioned in grid formation within project containers
- Calculated positioning: `taskX = padding + (col * (taskWidth + spacing))`
- Tasks arranged in rows and columns for clean organization
- Header space reserved for project title and metadata

**Improved Styling:**
- Fixed task node dimensions to consistent 200px width × 80px min-height
- Added `overflow: visible` to project content area for proper child visibility
- Consistent spacing and padding throughout the layout
- Project containers have minimum dimensions for proper display

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Dynamic sizing algorithm
const tasksInProject = tasks.length
const tasksPerRow = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(tasksInProject))
const projectWidth = Math.max(300, (tasksPerRow * taskWidth) + spacing + padding)
const projectHeight = Math.max(200, (rows * taskHeight) + spacing + padding + headerHeight)

// Grid positioning within project
const row = Math.floor(taskIndex / tasksPerRow)
const col = taskIndex % tasksPerRow
const taskX = projectPadding + (col * (taskWidth + taskSpacing))
const taskY = projectPadding + 60 + (row * (taskHeight + taskSpacing))
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Tasks properly nested inside project containers
- ✅ Project nodes dynamically resize to fit their content
- ✅ Clean grid layout for multiple tasks within projects
- ✅ Maintained proper edge connections (predecessor: right→left, child: bottom→top)
- ✅ Professional visual hierarchy and organization

---

### 2025-06-17 - Task Graph Edge Connection Fix

#### Bug Fixed:
Fixed incorrect edge connections in the task graph visualization where predecessor tasks were connecting to the wrong handle on the current task.

**Root Cause:**
- Predecessor task edges were using string values (`'right'`, `'left'`) instead of `Position` enum values
- This caused Vue Flow to default to connecting to the bottom handle instead of the left handle for the target

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated predecessor edge creation to use `Position.Right` for source handle and `Position.Left` for target handle
- Ensured consistent use of `Position` enum for all edge connections
- Child task edges also updated to use `Position.Bottom` and `Position.Top` for consistency

**Impact:**
- Predecessor tasks now correctly connect from their right handle to the current task's left handle
- Visual flow now properly represents the logical task dependency direction (left to right)
- Improved graph readability and intuitive understanding of task relationships

**Files Modified:**
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue`: Fixed edge handle positioning

**Troubleshooting Edge Connection Issue:**
- Added unique IDs to all Handle components (`id="left"`, `id="right"`, `id="top"`, `id="bottom"`)
- Temporarily disabled parent-child nesting to isolate edge connection issue
- Adjusted absolute positioning to place tasks outside project containers
- This will help determine if the issue is with edge targeting or parent-child positioning

**Next Steps:**
- Test edge connections with simplified layout
- Re-enable parent-child nesting once edge connections are confirmed working

---

### Project Node Transparency Update:
- Changed project container background from gradient to transparent
- Updated text color from white to dark purple (#4A148C) for better readability
- Made project content area fully transparent
- Updated project header border to use semi-transparent dark purple
- Added explicit icon color override to maintain visibility
- Maintained border and shadow for visual definition without background fill

**Visual Impact:**
- Project containers now act as transparent frames around task groups
- Better integration with overall graph background
- Cleaner, less cluttered appearance
- Task nodes remain fully visible and prominent within their project boundaries

### 2025-06-17 - Complete Notification Migration to useNotifications

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The application was using a legacy notification system in `App.vue` with a simple v-snackbar approach alongside the more sophisticated `useNotifications` composable. This created inconsistency and maintenance overhead:
1. **Dual Notification Systems**: Legacy `notify()` function and modern `useNotifications` composable coexisted
2. **Inconsistent User Experience**: Different notification styles and behaviors across the application
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Two systems to maintain and update
4. **Missing Features**: Legacy system lacked advanced features like action buttons, queuing, and proper persistence handling

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Unified Notification System**: All notifications now use the `useNotifications` composable
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Consistent notification styling and behavior throughout the application
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Removed ~30 lines of legacy notification code
- **Improved Maintainability**: Single notification system to maintain and extend
- **Enhanced Features**: Access to advanced notification features like action buttons, persistence, and queuing

#### New Features Added:
1. **NotificationContainer Component**: 
   - Global notification rendering component using Vuetify snackbars

### 2025-06-17 - App.vue Code Review and Refactoring

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The main `App.vue` component violated several key architectural principles from the coding standards:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Contained extensive authentication logic that should be delegated to composables
2. **Code Duplication**: Direct API calls duplicated functionality already available in the `useAuth` composable
3. **Type Safety**: Missing proper interfaces for function parameters
4. **Performance**: Not leveraging computed properties for reactive calculations
5. **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels and semantic attributes

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Removed ~100 lines of authentication logic from App.vue
- **Improved Maintainability**: Authentication logic now centralized in composables
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all function parameters
- **Better Performance**: Implemented computed properties for reactive calculations

#### New Features Added:
1. **Enhanced Type Safety**: 
   - `LoginCredentials` interface for login form data
   - `RegistrationData` interface for registration form data
   - `PasswordChangeData` interface for password change operations
   - `ProfileUpdateData` interface for profile updates

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - `themeIcon` computed property for theme toggle button
   - `hasOpenDialog` computed property for dialog state management

3. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - ARIA labels for theme toggle button
   - ARIA labels for user menu button
   - ARIA labels for navigation drawer
   - Enhanced navigation item accessibility
   - Added icons to menu items for better visual recognition

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Authentication Logic Duplication**: Replaced direct API calls with existing `useAuth` composable
- **Missing Error Handling**: Errors now properly handled by composables with consistent notification patterns
- **Type Safety Issues**: All function parameters now properly typed with interfaces

2. **Composable Usage**: Properly leverages existing `useAuth` and `useNotifications` composables
3. **Code Organization**: Better structured with clear interfaces and computed properties
4. **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary reactivity calculations through computed properties
5. **Accessibility**: Enhanced user experience for screen readers and keyboard navigation
6. **Maintainability**: Simplified authentication handlers with centralized error handling

#### Documentation Updates:
1. **Enhanced JSDoc Comments**: Updated all function documentation to reflect new composable usage
2. **Interface Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation for all new TypeScript interfaces
3. **Deprecation Notices**: Added deprecation warning for legacy notification function

#### TODOs Addressed:
- ✅ Extracted authentication logic into composables (was in TODO comments)
- ✅ Improved type safety with proper interfaces
- ✅ Enhanced accessibility with ARIA labels
- ✅ Added computed properties for better performance
- ✅ Complete migration from legacy `notify()` function to `useNotifications` composable

#### Remaining TODOs:

### 2025-06-17 - Admin Menu/Page Implementation (Issue #114)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The existing system had debug information, backend configuration display, and database management functionality scattered across the user menu (triple-dot menu) in the top navigation. This violated the principle of logical grouping and made administrative functions less discoverable. Users needed a centralized location for system administration tasks, and the user menu was becoming cluttered with administrative functions that didn't belong there.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Improved Information Architecture**: Administrative functions now have a dedicated, discoverable location
- **Better User Experience**: Cleaner user menu focused on user-specific actions (profile, password change, logout)
- **Enhanced Administrative Capabilities**: New database backup functionality provides data protection
- **Better Security**: Administrative functions clearly separated from user functions
- **Maintained Existing Functionality**: All existing features preserved while improving organization

#### New Features Added:
1. **Administration Page** (`/fe/src/pages/admin.vue`):
   - Dedicated admin page accessible via `/admin` route
   - Four main sections: Debug Info, Backend Config, Database Management, Database Backup
   - Authentication required for access
   - Clean card-based UI using Vuetify components

2. **Database Backup System**:
   - Backend: Added `backupDatabase` GraphQL mutation
   - Database service methods for creating timestamped backups
   - Frontend service (`/fe/src/services/backup.ts`) for backup operations
   - Backups stored in `/data/backups/` directory with metadata

3. **Navigation Improvements**:
   - Added "Administration" item to sidebar navigation (last item)
   - Uses `mdi-cog-outline` icon with descriptive subtitle
   - Removed Debug Info and BE Config from user menu

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Added `backupDatabase` mutation to GraphQL schema

### 2025-06-17 - WORKLOG File Organization and Daily Entry Migration

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The main WORKLOG.md file had grown very large with entries spanning multiple dates, making it difficult to navigate and find specific changes. The file contained comprehensive daily entries that would benefit from better organization by date for improved maintainability and readability.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Improved Organization**: WORKLOG entries now organized into separate date-based files
- **Better Navigation**: Each date has its own dedicated file for easier reference
- **Reduced File Size**: Main WORKLOG.md is now smaller and more focused
- **Historical Preservation**: All original content preserved in appropriate date files
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Future WORKLOG entries can follow the established date-based pattern

#### New Features Added:
- **Date-Based WORKLOG Files**:
  - `WORKLOG 20250617.md`: June 17, 2025 entries (3 entries covering project nesting, edge connections, and UI improvements)
  - `WORKLOG 20250616.md`: June 16, 2025 entries (7 entries covering task graphs, reports, and UI enhancements)

- **Enhanced Existing Files**: Added remaining entries to `WORKLOG 20250616.md` and `WORKLOG 20250116.md`
- **Organized by Date**: All entries moved to their appropriate date-based files
- **Maintained Structure**: Each file follows consistent format with proper headers and sections

#### Documentation Structure:
Each date-based WORKLOG file follows the same structure:
- Clear date-based filename format: `WORKLOG YYYYMMDD.md`
- Consistent header format: `# WORKLOG YYYYMMDD.md`
- Date-specific subtitle: `## Change Log for [Month Day, Year]`
- All original entry content preserved exactly as written
- Proper markdown formatting maintained throughout

#### Benefits Achieved:

## 2025-01-19 - Database Switching Behavior Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis
**Question**: When the backend switches database, does it flush all in-memory data and reread data from new database?

**Answer**: **YES** - Complete data flush and reload occurs

### Analysis Summary

#### Database Switching Process (`DatabaseManager.switchToTag()`)
1. **Complete Instance Replacement**: 
   - `this.dataDb = await this.createDataDatabase(tag);` creates entirely new database instance
   - Old database instance is discarded (garbage collected)

2. **Fresh Data Loading**:
   - `createDataDatabase()` reads JSON file from disk using `fs.readFileSync()`
   - Data is freshly parsed with `JSON.parse(rawData)`
   - No caching or persistence of old data occurs

3. **Immediate Service Impact**:
   - All services access data via unified database interface with dynamic getters
   - Services immediately see new data through `dataDb.data.{entity}` references
   - No service restart or re-initialization required

#### Key Technical Details
- **Authentication data**: Remains unchanged (separate `authDb` instance)
- **Application data**: Completely replaced from new database file
- **Memory management**: Direct file-based approach with no caching layers
- **Access pattern**: Services use direct references to `this.db.data.{entity}` arrays

#### Impact Assessment
- ✅ **Data Consistency**: Complete isolation between database tags
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Old data is properly garbage collected
- ✅ **Performance**: Switching is atomic but requires full file read
- ✅ **Reliability**: No stale data or cache invalidation issues

### Implementation Files Analyzed
- `/be/src/utils/database-manager.utils.ts` - Core switching logic
- `/be/src/services/database.service.ts` - Unified database interface
- `/be/src/services/*.service.ts` - Service layer data access patterns
- `/be/src/resolvers/database.resolvers.ts` - GraphQL interface for switching

### Conclusions
The database switching mechanism provides complete data isolation with immediate effect. When switching tags:
1. All in-memory application data is flushed
2. New data is read fresh from the target database file
3. Services immediately access the new dataset
4. No data persistence or caching issues exist

This design ensures clean separation between different database environments/tags.

# Development Worklog

## 2025-06-17 - Database Switching Fix - Critical Bug Resolution

### Root Cause Analysis
**Issue**: Database switching was not working - frontend still showed data from previous database after switching tags.

**Root Cause**: The `getUnifiedDatabase()` method in `DatabaseService` was capturing database references at object creation time instead of dynamically accessing current instances.

### Problem Details
1. **Services held stale references**: Services were initialized with a unified database object that captured `authDb` and `dataDb` references
2. **No refresh after switching**: When `switchToTag()` changed `this.dataDb` to a new instance, the unified database object still referenced the old instance
3. **Data persistence illusion**: Services continued to see old data because they accessed stale database references

### Technical Fix Applied

#### Modified: `/be/src/services/database.service.ts`
**Before**:
```typescript
getUnifiedDatabase(): Database {
  const authDb = this.dbManager.getAuthDatabase();  // Captured once
  const dataDb = this.dbManager.getDataDatabase();  // Captured once
  
  return {
    get data() {
      return { /* uses captured references */ };
    }
  };
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
getUnifiedDatabase(): Database {
  const dbManager = this.dbManager; // Capture manager reference
  
  return {
    get data() {
      // Dynamically get current instances on each access
      const authDb = dbManager.getAuthDatabase();
      const dataDb = dbManager.getDataDatabase();
      return { /* uses current references */ };
    }
  };
}
```

#### Enhanced: `/be/src/utils/database-manager.utils.ts`
- Added detailed logging to track database switching behavior
- Added data count verification before/after switching

### Impact Assessment
- ✅ **Data Isolation**: Complete separation between database tags
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of old database instances  
- ✅ **Service Refresh**: All services immediately see new data after switching
- ✅ **Bi-directional**: Switching back restores original data correctly

### Testing & Verification

#### Created: `/be/tests/database-switching-behavior.test.ts`
Comprehensive test suite verifying:
1. Data from previous database disappears after switching
2. Each database tag maintains isolated data
3. Departments and organizations switch correctly
4. Bi-directional switching preserves data integrity

**Test Results**: ✅ All tests passing

### Debugging Process
1. **Initial Analysis**: Traced code flow through database manager and service layer
2. **Log Analysis**: Added logging to identify where references were captured
3. **Test Creation**: Built comprehensive test to verify actual vs expected behavior
4. **Root Cause**: Found closure capturing stale references in unified database
5. **Fix Implementation**: Made data access dynamic instead of static
6. **Verification**: Tests confirm complete data isolation between tags

### Lessons Learned
- **Closure Gotcha**: JavaScript closures can capture references that become stale
- **Dynamic Access**: Getters should access current state, not captured state
- **Test Coverage**: Need integration tests for state-changing operations
- **Logging Value**: Detailed logging helped identify the exact failure point

### Follow-up Actions
- ✅ Database switching now works correctly
- ✅ Frontend will see proper data isolation between database tags
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for database switching scenarios

## 2025-06-17 - Health Query Enhancement: Database Tag Information

### Feature Enhancement
**Added**: Current database tag information to GraphQL health query response

### Implementation Details

#### New GraphQL Schema Field
**Added to Query type**:
```graphql
"""
Get the current database tag in use
Returns the tag name of the currently active database
"""
databaseTag: String!
```

#### Modified Files

##### `/be/src/schema/index.ts`
- Added `databaseTag: String!` field to Query type
- Fixed missing `teamMembers(teamId: ID!): [TeamMember!]!` query field

##### `/be/src/resolvers/health.resolvers.ts`
- Updated `setServices()` to accept database service parameter
- Added `databaseTag` resolver that returns current database tag
- Enhanced logging for database tag operations

##### `/be/src/resolvers/index.ts`
- Updated `setHealthServices()` call to pass database service

### Technical Implementation

#### Resolver Logic
```typescript
databaseTag: (): string => {
  logger.debug({ operation: 'databaseTag' }, 'Getting current database tag');
  const tag = databaseService?.getCurrentTag() || 'default';
  logger.info({ operation: 'databaseTag', tag }, 'Database tag retrieved');
  return tag;
}
```

#### Service Integration
- Health resolvers now receive both UserService and DatabaseService
- Database tag is accessible without authentication (public information)
- Falls back to 'default' if database service unavailable

### Testing & Verification

#### Created: `/be/tests/health-database-tag.test.ts`
Comprehensive test coverage:
1. ✅ Returns current database tag in health query
2. ✅ Database tag changes when switching databases  
3. ✅ Database tag accessible without authentication

#### Test Results
- All new tests passing
- Existing health tests continue to pass
- No regression in existing functionality

### Frontend Integration
Frontend can now query the current database tag:

```graphql
query {
  health
  databaseTag
}
```

This provides real-time visibility into which database environment is currently active.

### Bug Fix: Missing Schema Definition
**Fixed**: `teamMembers` query resolver had no corresponding schema definition
- Added missing `teamMembers(teamId: ID!): [TeamMember!]!` to schema
- Resolved GraphQL server startup error

### Benefits
- ✅ **Transparency**: Frontend shows which database tag is active
- ✅ **Debugging**: Easy verification of database switching
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Health checks include database environment info
- ✅ **Public Access**: No authentication required for database tag info

### 2025-06-17 - Task Graph Display Improvements

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The existing TaskGraphDialog component had a basic visualization of task relationships using Vue Flow, but lacked advanced visual features that would help users better understand task status, priorities, progress, and relationships. The graph was functional but not visually informative enough for effective project management.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced Visual Clarity**: Task nodes now display status, priority, and progress information at a glance

#### New Features Added:
1. **Visual Status Indicators**:
   - Color-coded status indicators on task nodes (green=completed, blue=in-progress, etc.)
   - Dynamic task icons based on status (play icon for in-progress, check for completed)
   - Status-based border colors for immediate visual feedback

2. **Priority Visualization**:
   - Priority badges in top-left corner of task nodes
   - Color coding: green=low, orange=medium, red=high, pulsing red=critical
   - Icon-based priority indicators (!,!!,!!!, ⚠)

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Progress bars showing task completion percentage
   - Status-based progress calculation
   - Visual progress indicators with percentage text

4. **Interactive Graph Controls**:
   - Filter chips to show/hide predecessors and child tasks
   - Zoom in/out controls
   - Fit-to-view functionality  
   - Refresh graph button
   - Toggle minimap option (prepared for future enhancement)

5. **Enhanced Task Information**:
   - Date information display (planned start dates)
   - Evaluator information
   - Project names and task complexity
   - Better typography and spacing

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Enhanced Node Templates**: Updated currentTask, predecessor, and childTask node templates with rich information display

- **Graph State Management**: Implemented visibility filtering based on user selections
- **TypeScript Improvements**: Added proper type definitions for mappings and resolved type errors
- **CSS Enhancements**: Added comprehensive styling for status indicators, priority badges, progress bars, and responsive design

#### Improvements Made:
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between current task, predecessors, and child tasks
- **Information Density**: Balanced information display without overwhelming the interface
- **Accessibility**: Color coding combined with icons and text for better accessibility
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering and update mechanisms
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured utility functions and clear component organization

#### Follow-up TODOs:
- Implement actual Vue Flow Background, Controls, and MiniMap components (requires package updates)
- Add hover tooltips with detailed task information
- Implement click-to-navigate functionality to task details
- Add animation transitions for node visibility changes
- Consider implementing node clustering for large graphs
- Add export functionality for graph visualization

#### Recent Layout Improvements (June 17, 2025):
- **Hierarchical Layout Structure**: Implemented requested layout with predecessors on the left, current task in center, and child tasks below extending right
- **Improved Project Container Sizing**: Project nodes now properly encompass all contained task nodes with appropriate padding
- **Optimized Task Spacing**: Set task spacing to half the node width (100px) for better visual balance
- **Enhanced Edge Styling**: Fixed Vue Flow edge type compatibility by using default edge type with custom styling (dashed lines for predecessors, solid for child tasks)
- **Better Proportions**: Increased task node minimum height to 100px and ensured consistent 200px width across all node types
- **Vue Flow Compatibility Fix**: Resolved "[Vue Flow]: Edge type is missing" error by removing explicit edge type and using Vue Flow defaults
- **Project Node Sizing Fix**: Fixed project container dimensions by properly configuring Vue Flow node style properties with px units and adding CSS overrides to ensure dynamic sizing works correctly

#### Potential Issues/Risks:
- Vue Flow component imports need to be verified for available features
- Large graphs may need performance optimization
- Mobile responsiveness may need additional testing
- Filter state persistence across dialog reopening

### 2025-06-17 - Navigation Logic Extraction to useNavigation Composable

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The navigation logic in `App.vue` was tightly coupled to the component, making it difficult to reuse and test. The navigation state, items configuration, and access control logic were all embedded within the main application component:
1. **Tight Coupling**: Navigation drawer state and items were directly managed in App.vue
2. **Code Duplication**: Navigation logic couldn't be reused across components
3. **Testing Complexity**: Navigation behavior was difficult to test in isolation
4. **Maintainability Issues**: Navigation changes required modifying the main app component
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Navigation logic mixed with authentication and theme management

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Navigation logic now isolated in dedicated composable
- **Improved Reusability**: Navigation state and items can be used across multiple components
- **Enhanced Testing**: Navigation logic can be tested independently

### 2025-06-17 - Loading States Implementation for Authentication Operations

#### Root Cause Analysis:
Authentication operations lacked proper loading indicators, leading to poor user experience during API calls. Users could trigger multiple simultaneous operations or feel uncertain about whether their actions were being processed:
1. **No Visual Feedback**: Users had no indication that authentication operations were in progress
2. **Multiple Operations Risk**: Users could accidentally trigger multiple authentication requests simultaneously
3. **Poor UX**: No feedback during potentially slow network operations (login, registration, password changes)
4. **Interface Responsiveness**: UI remained fully interactive during auth operations, potentially causing confusion
5. **Missing Best Practices**: Standard practice for async operations requires loading states

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Clear visual feedback during all authentication operations
- **Prevented Race Conditions**: Disabled UI interactions during authentication operations to prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- **Improved Accessibility**: Screen readers and assistive technologies can better understand application state
- **Professional Polish**: Loading indicators provide modern, expected user interface behavior
- **Better Error Handling**: Users can clearly distinguish between loading, success, and error states

#### New Features Added:
1. **Global Loading Overlay**:
   - Full-screen overlay with spinner and contextual messaging
   - Operation-specific loading messages (Login, Registration, Password Change, etc.)
   - Vuetify v-progress-circular with proper accessibility attributes
   - Non-intrusive design that doesn't block critical app functionality

2. **Per-Dialog Loading States**:
   - Individual loading props passed to each authentication dialog component
   - LoginCard, RegisterCard, PasswordResetCard, ChangePasswordCard, LogoutCard, and ProfileCard all receive loading state
   - Dialogs can implement their own loading indicators and disable form controls

3. **UI State Management**:
   - User menu disabled during authentication operations
   - Individual menu items disabled to prevent conflicting operations
   - Navigation drawer remains functional (non-authentication related)
   - Theme toggle remains available during auth operations

4. **Enhanced Authentication Flow**:
   - Dialogs only close when operations are complete (not during loading)
   - Proper error handling with loading state management
   - Loading states managed entirely by useAuth composable for consistency

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Loading State Integration**: All six loading states from useAuth composable integrated into App.vue
- **Computed Property**: `isAuthLoading` computed property aggregates all authentication loading states
- **Template Enhancements**: Loading props passed to all authentication dialog components
- **Interaction Control**: Menu and dialog interactions disabled during loading states
- **Clean Architecture**: Loading logic encapsulated in composable, UI only consumes state

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Multiple Operation Prevention**: Users can no longer trigger multiple simultaneous auth operations
- **Undefined State Issues**: Clear loading vs. completed vs. error states for all operations
- **Dialog Closing Issues**: Dialogs no longer close prematurely during ongoing operations
- **Navigation Handling Issues**: Removed direct router navigation from component (handled by composable)

#### Improvements Made:
1. **Code Quality**: Removed unused router import and direct navigation handling
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Navigation handled by composables, not component-level logic
3. **User Experience**: Professional loading indicators with contextual messaging
4. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA attributes and screen reader support for loading states
5. **Performance**: Computed properties efficiently manage loading state aggregation
6. **Maintainability**: Centralized loading state management in composables

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated App.vue component documentation to reflect loading states implementation
- Completed TODO item for "Implement loading states for authentication operations"
- Enhanced function documentation with loading state handling details

### 2025-06-17 - Dialog Management Composable Implementation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The main `App.vue` component was managing multiple individual dialog state refs (`showLogin`, `showRegister`, `showReset`, `showChange`, `showLogout`, `showProfile`, `showDatabaseSwitch`) which created several architectural issues:
1. **Scattered State Management**: Multiple boolean refs for each dialog type
2. **Code Duplication**: Repetitive dialog open/close logic throughout the component
3. **Poor Maintainability**: Adding new dialogs required multiple code changes
4. **Missing Consistency**: No standardized approach to dialog configuration and behavior
5. **Limited Features**: No support for advanced dialog management features like stacking, persistence, or bulk operations

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Centralized Dialog State**: All dialog states managed through a single `useDialogManager` composable
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed dialog names and operations prevent runtime errors
- **Consistent API**: Standardized `openDialog()`/`closeDialog()` methods across the application
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Adding new dialogs requires minimal code changes
- **Advanced Features**: Built-in support for single dialog mode, state persistence, and bulk operations
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized dialog state management with computed properties and reactive updates

#### New Features Added:
1. **useDialogManager Composable**:
   - Centralized dialog state management with type-safe operations
   - Support for 7 dialog types: login, register, reset, change, logout, profile, databaseSwitch
   - Single dialog mode to prevent multiple dialogs open simultaneously
   - Optional state persistence in localStorage (disabled by default for security)
   - Bulk operations: `closeAllDialogs()`, `resetDialogs()`
   - Utility methods: `toggleDialog()`, `isDialogOpen()`, `updateDialogConfig()`
   - Built-in logging and debugging support

2. **Enhanced App.vue Architecture**:
   - Replaced 7 individual dialog refs with single `dialogs` reactive object
   - Simplified dialog open/close handlers using `openDialog()`/`closeDialog()`
   - All dialog v-models now use `dialogs.{type}.isOpen` pattern
   - Consistent dialog configuration with default settings
   - Improved code organization and readability

3. **Type Safety Improvements**:
   - `DialogType` union type for all supported dialog types
   - `DialogConfig` interface for consistent dialog configuration
   - `DialogManagerOptions` interface for composable configuration
   - Proper TypeScript support throughout the dialog management system

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Dialog State Conflicts**: Prevented multiple dialogs from being open simultaneously
- **Inconsistent Dialog Behavior**: Standardized dialog opening/closing across all types
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup and state management prevents memory issues
- **Type Safety Issues**: Eliminated runtime errors from incorrect dialog references

#### Improvements Made:
1. **Code Quality**: Reduced App.vue complexity by ~40 lines and improved maintainability
2. **Architecture Compliance**: Follows composable-first approach and separation of concerns
3. **Developer Experience**: Simple, consistent API for dialog management
4. **Performance**: Optimized state updates and computed properties for better performance
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new dialog types and features
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples

#### Files Modified:
- `/fe/src/App.vue` - Integrated useDialogManager composable
- `/fe/src/composables/useDialogManager.ts` - New centralized dialog management composable

#### Technical Details:
- **State Management**: Uses Vue 3 `reactive()` for dialog states with `readonly()` exposure
- **Computed Properties**: `hasOpenDialog`, `activeDialog`, and `openDialogCount` for reactive state tracking
- **Event Handling**: Proper dialog lifecycle management with logging and error handling
- **Configuration**: Flexible options system for customizing dialog manager behavior
- **Persistence**: Optional localStorage integration for user preferences (security-conscious defaults)

#### TODO Items Added:
- Dialog state persistence for user preferences (optional feature)
- Dialog stacking/queue management for complex workflows
- Dialog transition animations configuration
- Dialog analytics tracking for usage insights
- Enhanced accessibility features (focus management, keyboard navigation)

The dialog management system is now fully implemented and provides a robust foundation for all dialog interactions in the application. The implementation follows Vue 3 composition API best practices and maintains full type safety throughout.
