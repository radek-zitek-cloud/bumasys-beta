# WORKLOG - 20250121

## Summary
Implemented consistent use of `useNotifications` and `useLogger` composables across the frontend codebase to address issue #129.

## Root Cause Analysis
The frontend code had inconsistent notification and logging patterns:
1. Multiple notification systems in use (main `useNotifications` vs legacy `shared/useNotifications`)
2. Manual notification patterns with individual `v-snackbar` components instead of centralized system
3. Direct `console.log/error` calls instead of structured logging via `useLogger` composable

## Impact of Changes
- **Standardized notifications**: All pages now use the main `useNotifications` composable
- **Improved maintainability**: Single notification system to maintain instead of multiple patterns
- **Better user experience**: Consistent notification styling and behavior across all pages
- **Enhanced logging**: Structured logging with proper error tracking instead of console outputs
- **Developer experience**: Simplified APIs with better TypeScript support

## New Features Added
- None (refactoring/standardization task)

## Bugs Fixed
- Fixed inconsistent notification systems across frontend pages
- Replaced manual notification patterns with standardized composable usage
- Standardized error logging across application

## Improvements Made
### Notification System Standardization
- `people.vue`: Updated from legacy `shared/useNotifications` to main `useNotifications`
- `admin.vue`: Replaced manual notification pattern with `useNotifications` composable
- `teams.vue`: Replaced manual notification pattern with `useNotifications` composable  
- `references.vue`: Replaced manual notification pattern with `useNotifications` composable
- `tasks.vue`: Replaced manual notification pattern with `useNotifications` composable
- `task-management/[id].vue`: Replaced manual notification pattern with `useNotifications` composable

### Logger Integration
- Added `useLogger` imports and replaced `console.error` calls with `logError` in:
  - `people.vue` 
  - `teams.vue`
  - `references.vue`
  - `tasks.vue`
  - `task-management/[id].vue`

### Code Cleanup
- Removed manual `v-snackbar` components from templates
- Removed custom `notify()` and `showNotification()` functions
- Removed manual snackbar state management (`snackbar`, `snackbarMessage`, `snackbarColor` refs)

## Documentation Updates
- This worklog documents the changes made
- Existing migration guide (`docs/NOTIFICATION_MIGRATION.md`) already covers the patterns implemented

## TODOs or Follow-up Tasks
- [ ] Consider updating component-level console calls to use logger where appropriate
- [ ] Monitor notification system performance with unified usage
- [ ] Review if any additional pages need similar updates

## Potential Issues or Risks Identified
- **Low risk**: Changes are primarily refactoring existing functionality
- **Testing recommended**: Verify all notification flows work correctly in dev/test environments
- **No breaking changes**: All existing notification functionality preserved, just centralized

## Technical Details
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Type checking passes without errors
- No new dependencies added
- Leverages existing `NotificationContainer` component in `App.vue`
- Follows established patterns from the migration guide
