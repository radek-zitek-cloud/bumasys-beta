### 2025-01-16 - Task Graph Display Feature Implementation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The system needed a graphical display of task relationships to improve task management visibility. The issue requested a "Display Graph" button on the task management page that would open a dialog showing task relationships using Vue Flow. This was a new feature implementation rather than a bug fix.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **New Feature Added**: Task Graph visualization using Vue Flow library
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can now visualize task relationships in a graphical format
- **Consistent UI Pattern**: New dialog follows the same design patterns as existing dialogs (StaffTreeDialog, DepartmentTreeDialog)
- **Minimal Scope**: Initially displays only the current task as a single node (as requested)
- **Future Extensible**: Architecture supports future expansion to show predecessors, successors, and child tasks

#### New Features Added:
- **Task Graph Dialog**: New Vue Flow-based component for displaying task relationships
- **Display Graph Button**: Added button to task management page header with proper tooltip
- **Vue Flow Integration**: Installed and configured Vue Flow library for graph visualization

#### Technical Changes:

**New Dependencies Added:**
- `@vue-flow/core`: Core Vue Flow library for graph visualization
- `@vue-flow/controls`: Additional controls for Vue Flow
- `@vue-flow/minimap`: Minimap component for Vue Flow

**New Files Created:**
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue`: Main task graph dialog component
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskGraphDialog.test.ts`: Unit tests for the component

**Modified Files:**
- `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue`: Added Display Graph button and dialog integration
- `fe/package.json`: Added Vue Flow dependencies
- `fe/src/components.d.ts`: Auto-generated component declarations

**Code Changes:**
```diff
// In task management page header:
+ <v-btn
+   color="white"
+   icon="mdi-graph"
+   size="small"
+   variant="text"
+   @click="openTaskGraphDialog"
+ >
+   <v-icon>mdi-graph</v-icon>
+   <v-tooltip activator="parent" location="bottom">Display Graph</v-tooltip>
+ </v-btn>

// New dialog component:
+ <v-dialog v-model="showTaskGraphDialog" fullscreen persistent>
+   <TaskGraphDialog
+     v-if="task"
+     :task="task"
+     @close="showTaskGraphDialog = false"
+   />
+ </v-dialog>
```

#### Implementation Details:
- **Single Node Display**: Initially shows only the current task as a single node with task name and project
- **Responsive Design**: Dialog takes most of the screen space (90vw x 80vh)
- **Consistent Styling**: Follows Vuetify design patterns with primary colors
- **Error Handling**: Includes loading states and error handling
- **Vue Flow Features**: Includes zoom, pan, and basic interactivity

#### Testing:
- **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive unit tests for component functionality
- **Build Verification**: All builds and type checking pass successfully
- **Lint Compliance**: Code follows project linting standards

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated WORKLOG.md with comprehensive change documentation
- Component includes detailed JSDoc comments
- Code follows established patterns from similar components

#### TODOs and Follow-up Tasks:
- Future enhancement: Add predecessor/successor task nodes
- Future enhancement: Add child task nodes
- Future enhancement: Add interactive node actions
- Future enhancement: Add different node types/colors for different task statuses
- Future enhancement: Add edge connections between related tasks

#### Potential Issues or Risks Identified:
- Vue Flow requires ResizeObserver which may not be available in all test environments
- Component may need performance optimization for large task graphs in future
- Current implementation is basic; complex graphs may require additional UI/UX considerations

### 2025-01-16 - Teams Participants Filtering Bug Fix

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Teams Management page had a critical bug where after adding, updating, or removing team members, the members list would reload with members from ALL teams instead of maintaining the filter for the currently selected team. This occurred because the team member management functions were calling both `loadTeamMembers(selectedTeamForMembers.value.id)` (correct - loads specific team's members) and `loadAllTeamMembers()` (incorrect - overwrites with all team members), causing the UI to lose the team-specific filtering.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Fixed Team Member Filtering**: When managing a specific team's members, only that team's members are now displayed after CRUD operations
- **Improved User Experience**: Users can now safely add/edit/remove team members without losing context of which team they're working with
- **Maintained Data Integrity**: Team member operations continue to work correctly while preserving proper UI state
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact with minimal code modifications

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Team Participants Filter Loss**: Fixed issue where team member lists would show members from all teams after add/update/remove operations
- **UI State Management**: Maintained proper filtering context during team member management operations

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Files:**
- `fe/src/pages/teams.vue`: Removed unnecessary `loadAllTeamMembers()` calls from team member management functions

**Code Changes:**
```diff
// In handleAddTeamMember function:
  if (selectedTeamForMembers.value) {
    await loadTeamMembers(selectedTeamForMembers.value.id)
  }
- await loadAllTeamMembers()

// In handleUpdateTeamMember function:
  if (selectedTeamForMembers.value) {
    await loadTeamMembers(selectedTeamForMembers.value.id)
  }
- await loadAllTeamMembers()

// In handleRemoveTeamMember function:
  if (selectedTeamForMembers.value) {
    await loadTeamMembers(selectedTeamForMembers.value.id)
  }
- await loadAllTeamMembers()
```

#### New Features Added:
- None (bug fix only)

#### Improvements Made:
- **Surgical Code Changes**: Only 3 lines removed, 0 lines added - minimal impact approach
- **Preserved Existing Functionality**: All existing team management features continue to work as expected
- **Enhanced UI Consistency**: Team member filtering now behaves predictably across all operations

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated WORKLOG.md with detailed analysis of the filtering bug and its resolution

#### Testing Results:
- **All Existing Tests Pass**: 271 tests pass with no regressions introduced
- **No Linting Errors**: No new linting issues introduced by the changes
- **Minimal Change Validation**: Only 3 lines deleted, 0 lines added - confirms surgical approach

#### Potential Issues or Risks Identified:
- **Team Member Count Display**: The team member count chips in the main teams table might become slightly stale until the page is refreshed, but this is a minor UI issue compared to the critical filtering bug that was fixed
- **Performance Impact**: Positive - eliminated unnecessary loading of all team members during specific team operations

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Monitor user feedback to ensure the fix resolves the reported issue completely
- Consider implementing real-time team member count updates if the stale count becomes problematic

### 2025-01-16 - Teams Page UI Consistency: Move Create Team Button to Card

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Teams Management page had an inconsistent UI pattern where the "Create Team" button was positioned in the page header (outside the main data card), while all other data maintenance pages in the application follow a consistent pattern of placing action buttons inside the card titles. This inconsistency affected user experience and violated the established design system patterns used throughout the application.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **UI Consistency**: Teams page now follows the same design pattern as other data management pages (References, People, etc.)
- **Improved User Experience**: Users can now find action buttons in a consistent location across all data management interfaces
- **Design System Compliance**: Maintains consistency with established UI patterns throughout the application
- **Responsive Layout**: Better utilization of card space and improved mobile responsiveness

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **UI Inconsistency**: Fixed inconsistent placement of Create Team button by moving it from page header to card title section

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Files:**
- `fe/src/pages/teams.vue`: Moved Create Team button from page header to Teams card title section

**Code Changes:**
```diff
- <!-- Page Header with Create Team button -->
- <div class="d-flex justify-space-between align-center mb-6">
-   <div>
-     <h1 class="text-h4 mb-2">Teams Management</h1>
-     <p class="text-subtitle-1 text-medium-emphasis">
-       Manage teams and team member assignments
-     </p>
-   </div>
-   <v-btn
-     color="primary"
-     prepend-icon="mdi-account-multiple-plus"
-     @click="openCreateDialog"
-   >
-     Create Team
-   </v-btn>
- </div>

+ <!-- Simplified Page Header -->
+ <div class="mb-6">
+   <h1 class="text-h4 mb-2">Teams Management</h1>
+   <p class="text-subtitle-1 text-medium-emphasis">
+     Manage teams and team member assignments
+   </p>
+ </div>

  <!-- Teams Table with integrated Create button -->
  <v-card-title>
    <div class="d-flex justify-space-between align-center w-100">
      <span>Teams ({{ filteredTeams.length }})</span>
-     <v-text-field ... />
+     <div class="d-flex gap-2 align-center">
+       <v-btn
+         color="primary"
+         prepend-icon="mdi-plus"
+         size="small"
+         @click="openCreateDialog"
+       >
+         Create Team
+       </v-btn>
+       <v-text-field ... />
+     </div>
    </div>
  </v-card-title>
```

#### Design Pattern Consistency:
- Changed button icon from `mdi-account-multiple-plus` to `mdi-plus` to match other pages
- Added `size="small"` to match the styling used in References and People pages  
- Positioned button before the search field in the card title section
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving visual consistency

#### Validation:
- ✅ Type checking passes
- ✅ Build completes successfully  
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ No functional changes - only UI positioning

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider standardizing this pattern across any remaining pages that might have similar inconsistencies
- Document this UI pattern in the component library or design system documentation

### 2025-01-16 - Staff Organization Chart Fix: Display Hierarchy from Selected Staff Member

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Staff Organization Chart (Staff Tree Dialog) was always displaying the complete organizational hierarchy starting from the highest-level manager (root staff member), regardless of which staff member was selected. This occurred because the `findRootStaff` function was traversing up the supervisory hierarchy to find the topmost staff member with no supervisor, then building the entire organizational tree from that point. Users expected the chart to show the selected staff member as the root node, displaying only their subordinates and downward hierarchy.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Focused Hierarchy Display**: Staff organization chart now starts from the selected staff member as the root node
- **Improved User Experience**: Users can now view targeted organizational subsets rather than always seeing the full company structure
- **Contextual Navigation**: When clicking on a manager, users see only their team and subordinates
- **Flexible Organizational Views**: Different starting points provide different perspectives of the organizational structure
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Smaller, focused trees are easier to navigate and understand

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Staff Orgchart Root Issue**: Fixed the organization chart to start from the selected staff member instead of always showing the full organizational hierarchy from the top-level root

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Files:**
- `fe/src/components/organization/StaffTreeDialog.vue`: Updated `initializeTree()` function to use the selected staff member directly as the tree root instead of finding the organizational root

**Code Changes:**
```diff
- // Find the root of the hierarchy for the selected staff member
- const rootStaff = findRootStaff(allStaff, props.staff)
- 
- // Build tree structure starting from the root
- const treeStructure = buildStaffTree(allStaff, rootStaff)
+ // Build tree structure starting from the selected staff member
+ const treeStructure = buildStaffTree(allStaff, props.staff)
```

#### Improvements Made:
- **Minimal Code Change**: Only 2 lines added, 5 lines removed for surgical fix
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added focused tests to prevent regression
- **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Performance Optimization**: No additional API calls or processing overhead

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated WORKLOG.md with detailed change documentation
- Enhanced test coverage documentation
- Root cause analysis and solution approach documented

#### Potential Issues or Risks Identified:
- **Unused Function**: `findRootStaff` function remains in codebase but is no longer used (minimal impact, left for potential future use)
- **Test Warnings**: Linter warnings about unused imports in other components (unrelated to this fix)

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding UI indicator showing the selected staff member as root in the dialog title
- Potential enhancement to add breadcrumb navigation for moving between organizational levels
- Consider adding "View Full Organization" option for users who want to see complete hierarchy

### 2025-01-16 - Git Branch Reset: Synchronized Local Main with Remote Origin

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The local main branch had diverged from the remote origin/main branch and was 18 commits behind. This divergence can occur when working on local changes while the remote repository continues to receive updates from other contributors or automated processes. The local repository contained uncommitted changes that needed to be either preserved or discarded before synchronizing with the remote.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Branch Synchronization**: Local main branch is now perfectly synchronized with remote origin/main
- **Clean Working Tree**: All uncommitted changes have been removed, providing a clean starting point
- **Latest Codebase**: Access to the most recent 18 commits from the remote repository
- **Resolved Divergence**: Eliminated potential merge conflicts and confusion from diverged branches

#### Operations Performed:

**Git Repository Management**:
- **Remote Fetch**: Retrieved latest changes from origin repository
  - Fetched 201 objects with 134 deltas resolved
  - Discovered 18 commits difference between local and remote main

- **Branch Backup**: Created temporary backup branch `backup-local-main-20250616-163711`
  - Attempted to preserve any local changes before reset
  - Backup branch was subsequently removed as unnecessary

- **Hard Reset**: Executed `git reset --hard origin/main`
  - Completely replaced local main branch with remote origin/main
  - Working directory now matches remote repository exactly

#### Current State:
- **Branch Status**: `main` branch up to date with `origin/main`
- **Latest Commit**: `b969ea4` - "feat: Add CreateUserFromStaffDialog component and integrate into user management"
- **Working Tree**: Clean with no uncommitted changes
- **Repository Health**: Fully synchronized with remote origin

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated WORKLOG.md with complete details of the git reset operation
- Documented the synchronization process for future reference
- Noted the impact and reasoning behind the branch reset decision

#### Follow-up Actions:
- None required - repository is now in a clean, synchronized state
- Future work can proceed from the latest remote codebase
- Any new development should start from this synchronized main branch
