## Change Log

### 2025-01-21 - Task Details Updates Implementation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The task management page had limited functionality for editing task details, and reports were displayed in list format which didn't provide optimal data visibility. The task details form lacked important fields like evaluator, parent task, and date fields, and there was no way to save changes to task information.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced Task Editing**: Users can now edit all task fields directly in the task details page
- **Improved Data Layout**: Reorganized task details into a more logical 4-row layout for better space utilization
- **Better Data Visualization**: Converted progress and status reports from lists to data tables for improved readability
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Added Save/Undo functionality with proper state management

#### New Features Added:
1. **Editable Task Details Form**:
   - All task fields are now editable (name, description, parent task, evaluator, status, priority, complexity, dates)
   - Added Save/Undo buttons with proper form state tracking
   - Real-time validation and feedback

2. **Improved Layout Organization**:
   - Row 1: Task name, Project, Parent task
   - Row 2: Description (full width)
   - Row 3: Evaluator, Status, Priority, Complexity
   - Row 4: Planned start/end dates, Actual start/end dates

3. **Enhanced Field Types**:
   - Date pickers for start/end dates
   - Dropdown selectors for parent task, evaluator, status, priority, complexity
   - Proper form controls with validation

4. **Data Table Conversion**:
   - Progress reports: 5-column table (percentage, note, creator, date, actions)
   - Status reports: 4-column table (summary, creator, date, actions)
   - Improved sorting by date (descending)
   - Color-coded progress indicators

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// Added reactive form data structure
const taskForm = reactive({
  name: '', description: '', parentTaskId: '', evaluatorId: '',
  statusId: '', priorityId: '', complexityId: '',
  plannedStartDate: '', plannedEndDate: '', actualStartDate: '', actualEndDate: ''
})

// State management for form modifications
const taskFormModified = ref(false)
watch(taskForm, () => { taskFormModified.value = true }, { deep: true })

// Save functionality
async function saveTaskChanges() {
  const updateData: UpdateTaskInput = { id: task.value.id, ...taskForm }
  const { updateTask: updatedTask } = await updateTask(updateData)
  task.value = updatedTask
  taskFormModified.value = false
}
```

#### Bugs Fixed:
- Task details were previously read-only, preventing users from making necessary updates
- Progress reports were sorted by percentage instead of date
- Reports displayed in list format made data comparison difficult
- Missing important task fields (evaluator, parent task, dates) in the UI

#### Improvements Made:
- **Performance**: Optimized form reactivity with proper watchers
- **UX**: Added compact density to forms for better space utilization  
- **Accessibility**: Proper form labels and validation feedback
- **Visual Design**: Color-coded progress chips and consistent styling
- **Data Management**: Proper TypeScript typing and error handling

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated component documentation with new functionality
- Added proper JSDoc comments for new functions
- Updated type definitions for enhanced form data

#### TODOs and Follow-up Tasks:
- [ ] Consider enhancing predecessor/child task dialogs to support both "select existing" and "create new" options
- [ ] Add form validation rules for date fields (start date should be before end date)
- [ ] Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for Save (Ctrl+S) and Undo (Ctrl+Z)
- [ ] Add confirmation dialog for unsaved changes when navigating away
- [ ] Consider adding auto-save functionality for long editing sessions

#### Potential Issues and Risks Identified:
- **Data Loss Risk**: Users might accidentally navigate away without saving changes
- **Validation**: Date field validation could be enhanced to prevent logical errors
- **Performance**: Large numbers of reports in tables might impact rendering performance
- **Browser Compatibility**: Date input fields may render differently across browsers

#### Testing Status:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build process successful  
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Lint checks pass (file-specific)
- ✅ Form state management works correctly
- ✅ Table rendering and sorting functional

### 2025-06-17 - Dynamic Project Sizing and Parent-Child Nesting Restoration

#### Improvements Made:
**Re-enabled Parent-Child Nesting:**
- Restored `parentNode` and `extent: 'parent'` properties for proper task nesting
- Tasks are now properly contained within their project nodes
- Maintained working edge connections with proper handle targeting

**Dynamic Project Node Sizing:**
- Implemented intelligent project container sizing based on number of contained tasks
- Projects now arrange tasks in a grid layout (roughly square) for optimal space usage
- Dynamic width/height calculation: `projectWidth = max(300, (tasksPerRow * taskWidth) + spacing + padding)`
- Projects automatically resize to fit all their tasks without overflow

**Grid Layout for Tasks Within Projects:**
- Tasks positioned in grid formation within project containers
- Calculated positioning: `taskX = padding + (col * (taskWidth + spacing))`
- Tasks arranged in rows and columns for clean organization
- Header space reserved for project title and metadata

**Improved Styling:**
- Fixed task node dimensions to consistent 200px width × 80px min-height
- Added `overflow: visible` to project content area for proper child visibility
- Consistent spacing and padding throughout the layout
- Project containers have minimum dimensions for proper display

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Dynamic sizing algorithm
const tasksInProject = tasks.length
const tasksPerRow = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(tasksInProject))
const projectWidth = Math.max(300, (tasksPerRow * taskWidth) + spacing + padding)
const projectHeight = Math.max(200, (rows * taskHeight) + spacing + padding + headerHeight)

// Grid positioning within project
const row = Math.floor(taskIndex / tasksPerRow)
const col = taskIndex % tasksPerRow
const taskX = projectPadding + (col * (taskWidth + taskSpacing))
const taskY = projectPadding + 60 + (row * (taskHeight + taskSpacing))
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Tasks properly nested inside project containers
- ✅ Project nodes dynamically resize to fit their content
- ✅ Clean grid layout for multiple tasks within projects
- ✅ Maintained proper edge connections (predecessor: right→left, child: bottom→top)
- ✅ Professional visual hierarchy and organization

### 2025-06-16 - Task Graph Nesting Implementation with Vue Flow Parent-Child Relationships

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The task graph visualization system had a fundamental design issue where tasks were displayed as separate, independent nodes rather than being properly nested inside their project containers. This made it difficult to understand project structure and task relationships at a glance.

Key issues identified:
1. **No True Nesting**: Tasks appeared near but not inside project nodes
2. **Poor Visual Hierarchy**: Project-task relationships were unclear
3. **Missing Container Semantics**: Project nodes didn't act as proper containers
4. **Scattered Layout**: Tasks from same project could appear anywhere on the graph

#### Impact of Changes:
- **True Hierarchical Visualization**: Tasks are now nested inside their project containers
- **Improved User Understanding**: Clear visual representation of project-task relationships
- **Better Organization**: Tasks grouped by project with proper container boundaries
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Users can easily identify which tasks belong to which projects
- **Multi-Project Support**: Handles complex scenarios with tasks spanning multiple projects

#### New Features Added:
- **Parent-Child Node Relationships**: Implemented Vue Flow `parentNode` property for proper nesting
- **Project Container Nodes**: Project nodes act as true containers with headers and content areas
- **Task Grouping Logic**: Algorithm to group all related tasks by their project
- **Connection Handle System**: Proper Vue Flow handles for all connection directions
- **Multi-Project Layout**: Horizontal layout for multiple project containers
- **Relative Positioning**: Task positions calculated relative to their parent project

#### Technical Implementation:

**Vue Flow Integration:**
- Implemented `parentNode: projectId` for child task nodes
- Added `extent: 'parent'` to constrain task movement within projects
- Used `Position` enum for proper handle positioning (Left, Right, Top, Bottom)
- Imported `Handle` component for connection points on all task nodes

**Core Algorithm Changes:**
```typescript
// Group all tasks by project
const tasksByProject = new Map()
for (const task of allTasks) {
  const projectId = task.project?.id || 'unknown'
  if (!tasksByProject.has(projectId)) {
    tasksByProject.set(projectId, { project, tasks: [] })
  }
  tasksByProject.get(projectId).tasks.push(task)
}

// Create project containers and nested task nodes
for (const [projectId, { project, tasks }] of tasksByProject.entries()) {
  // Project container node
  nodes.push({
    id: `project-${projectId}`,
    type: 'project',
    style: { width: projectWidth, height: projectHeight }
  })
  
  // Nested task nodes
  for (const task of tasks) {
    nodes.push({
      id: task.id,
      parentNode: `project-${projectId}`,
      extent: 'parent',
      position: { x: relativeX, y: relativeY }
    })
  }
}
```

**UI Component Enhancements:**
- **Project Container Template**: New container design with header and content sections
- **Handle Integration**: Added Vue Flow handles to all task node templates
- **Container Styling**: Purple gradient containers with proper headers
- **Task Node Updates**: Enhanced with connection handles for all directions
- **Responsive Layout**: Dynamic container sizing based on contained tasks

**Edge Connection Preservation:**
- Maintained predecessor→current task connections (right handle → left handle)
- Preserved current task→child task connections (bottom handle → top handle)
- Edge styling and behavior unchanged from previous implementation

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue` - Complete nesting implementation
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskGraphDialog.test.ts` - Fixed merge conflicts and enhanced tests
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskGraphNesting.test.ts` - New comprehensive nesting tests

#### Testing Results:
- **11/11 tests passing** (7 existing + 4 new nesting tests)
- **Type checking successful** with proper Vue Flow type imports
- **Logic verification** for task grouping and parent-child relationships
- **Edge connection testing** to ensure proper handle connections

#### Documentation Updates:
- Enhanced component documentation to reflect nesting capabilities
- Added technical notes about Vue Flow parent-child relationships
- Documented the task grouping algorithm and positioning logic

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding node interaction features (click to navigate to task/project)
- Potential enhancement: resize handles for project containers
- Future consideration: expand to show multi-level task hierarchies
- Performance optimization for large numbers of tasks per project

#### Potential Risks Identified:
- Large numbers of tasks in single project might need layout optimization
- Very wide project names could affect container sizing

### 2025-01-16 - Creator Display in Task Report Lists (Completed Issue #104)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Task Details page was missing creator information in the lists of status reports and progress reports. While the creator functionality was fully implemented in the backend and creation dialogs (as part of issue #102), the report lists only displayed date and content (summary/notes) without showing who created each report. Users needed visibility into report authorship for better accountability and traceability.

#### Impact of Changes:

- **Creator Display in Status Reports**: Shows "Creator: FirstName LastName" with account icon  
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only displays creator information when available
- **GraphQL Data Enhancement**: Extended query to fetch creator staff details

#### Technical Implementation:

**GraphQL Query Enhancement:**
- Enhanced `getTaskWithManagementData` query in `fe/src/services/tasks.ts`
- Added `creatorId` and `creator` fields to both report types
- Included staff details: id, firstName, lastName, email

**UI Component Updates:**
- Modified report list items in `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue`
- Added creator information as small caption text below main content
- Used conditional rendering with `v-if="report.creator"`
- Maintained existing prepend/append action button layouts

#### Code Quality:
- **Minimal Changes**: Only 2 files modified with targeted enhancements
- **Consistent Styling**: Used existing Vuetify design tokens and patterns
- **Type Safety**: Leveraged existing TypeScript interfaces
- **Linting Compliance**: All changes pass ESLint validation
- **Test Coverage**: Existing test suite continues to pass

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/services/tasks.ts` - Enhanced GraphQL query for creator data
- `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue` - Added creator display in both report lists

#### User Experience Impact:
- **Seamless Integration**: Creator information appears naturally in existing lists
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Creator shown as subtle caption text that doesn't compete with primary content
- **Icon Context**: Account icon provides visual cue for creator information
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality and workflows remain unchanged

This implementation successfully addresses the requirement to display creator information in task report lists while maintaining design consistency and user experience quality. The changes are surgical and focused, adding value without disrupting existing workflows.

### 2025-06-16 - UI Creator Field Implementation for Task Reports (Completed Issue #102)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The backend creator field functionality was already implemented, but the UI components lacked the necessary fields for manual creator selection. Users needed a way to select the report creator from eligible staff members (those assigned to the task or the evaluator) with automatic preset based on their email.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Added intuitive creator selection dropdowns in report creation dialogs
- **Smart Auto-Assignment**: Automatically presets creator when user email matches eligible staff
- **Manual Override Capability**: Users can manually select a different eligible creator
- **Consistent UI Patterns**: Follows established dialog component design patterns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interface definitions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests validate all creator field functionality

#### Technical Implementation:

**Frontend Interface Updates:**
- Enhanced `CreateTaskStatusReportInput` and `CreateTaskProgressInput` to include `creatorId?: string`
- Updated `TaskStatusReport` and `TaskProgress` interfaces to include creator information
- Modified GraphQL mutations to pass `creatorId` parameter to backend

**UI Component Enhancements:**
```vue
<!-- Creator Selection Dropdown -->
<v-select
  v-model="form.creatorId"
  clearable
  item-title="displayName"
  item-value="id"
  :items="staffOptions"
  label="Creator"
  prepend-icon="mdi-account-supervisor"
  variant="outlined"
/>
```

**Eligible Staff Logic:**
- Created computed property to identify eligible staff (assignees + evaluator)
- Prevents duplicate entries when evaluator is also assigned to task
- Formats staff display as "FirstName LastName (email)" for clarity

**Auto-Preset Functionality:**
```typescript
function presetCreator() {
  if (!authStore.user?.email || !props.eligibleStaff) return
  
  const matchingStaff = props.eligibleStaff.find(staff => 
    staff.email.toLowerCase() === authStore.user?.email.toLowerCase()
  )
  
  if (matchingStaff) {
    form.creatorId = matchingStaff.id
  }
}
```

**Component Props Enhancement:**
- Added `eligibleStaff?: Staff[]` prop to both dialog components
- Updated task management page to pass eligible staff data
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing usage

#### New Features Added:
- **Manual Creator Selection**: Dropdown allowing selection from eligible staff members
- **Smart Auto-Preset**: Automatically selects creator when user email matches staff
- **Visual Guidance**: Helper text explaining creator selection rules
- **Eligible Staff Filtering**: Only shows staff assigned to task or evaluator
- **Email-Based Matching**: Case-insensitive email matching for auto-assignment

#### Code Quality Improvements:
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Created test suite validating all creator field functionality
- **Linting Compliance**: Fixed style issues in modified files
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or invalid creator data

#### Testing Coverage:
- Creator dropdown display validation
- Auto-preset logic based on user email matching
- Form submission with creator data inclusion
- Staff options formatting verification
- Edge cases for non-matching emails

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/services/tasks.ts` - Interface and GraphQL mutation updates
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskStatusReportCreateDialog.vue` - Creator field UI
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskProgressCreateDialog.vue` - Creator field UI  
- `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue` - Eligible staff logic and prop passing
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskStatusReportCreateDialog.creator.test.ts` - Unit tests

#### User Experience Impact:
- **Seamless Workflow**: Most users will have creator auto-selected based on their email
- **Flexibility**: Manual override available when needed
- **Clear Guidance**: Helper text explains selection criteria
- **Consistent Design**: Matches other form elements in the application

This implementation successfully bridges the gap between the existing backend creator functionality and the frontend user interface, providing an intuitive and user-friendly way to manage report creators while maintaining all business rules and validation logic.

### 2025-01-03 - Enhanced Task Graph Dialog with Project, Predecessor, and Child Task Visualization

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The TaskGraphDialog component was displaying only a single task node without showing the broader context of task relationships. Users needed to see the task's position within its project hierarchy and understand its dependencies and breakdown structure. The existing implementation lacked visual representation of:
- Project context as a parent container
- Predecessor task dependencies (left-side positioning)
- Child task breakdown structure (bottom positioning)
- Proper edge connections between related nodes

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Task graph now displays comprehensive relationship mapping
- **Improved UX**: Users can visually understand task context and dependencies at a glance
- **Data Utilization**: Leverages existing backend relationship data (predecessors, childTasks, project)
- **Maintainable Code**: Preserved backward compatibility while adding new node types
- **Professional Appearance**: Color-coded nodes with distinct styling for each relationship type

#### New Features Added:
- **Project Node Visualization**: Purple gradient nodes representing the project container
- **Current Task Emphasis**: Blue gradient nodes with emphasized styling for the focal task
- **Predecessor Mapping**: Orange gradient nodes positioned to the left with connecting edges
- **Child Task Hierarchy**: Green gradient nodes positioned below with connecting edges
- **Edge Connections**: Color-coded edges showing relationship flow:
  - Blue edges: predecessor → current task
  - Green edges: current task → child tasks
- **Smart Positioning**: Calculated positioning algorithm for optimal layout
- **Multiple Node Types**: Vue Flow templates for project, currentTask, predecessor, and childTask nodes
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive positioning based on number of relationships

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Limited Context**: Users can now see full task context instead of isolated single node
- **Missing Relationships**: All task relationships are now visualized properly
- **Poor User Experience**: Enhanced graph provides meaningful visual information

#### Improvements Made:
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different node types using color coding
- **User Navigation**: Better understanding of task flow and dependencies
- **Data Integration**: Full utilization of existing GraphQL endpoint `getTaskWithManagementData`
- **Code Quality**: Maintained TypeScript compliance and linting standards
- **Test Coverage**: Enhanced test suite covering new node types and relationships

#### Technical Implementation:

**Enhanced Component Features:**
- Fetches complete task data including relationships via `getTaskWithManagementData`
- Implements smart positioning algorithm for different node types
- Creates Vue Flow elements array with nodes and edges
- Handles edge cases when relationships don't exist
- Maintains proper error handling and loading states

**Node Type Styling:**
```css
/* Project nodes: Purple gradient */
.custom-project-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6A1B9A, #8E24AA); }

/* Current task: Blue gradient (emphasized) */
.custom-current-task-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1976D2, #2196F3); }

/* Predecessors: Orange gradient */
.custom-predecessor-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FF8F00, #FFA726); }

/* Child tasks: Green gradient */
.custom-child-task-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #388E3C, #4CAF50); }
```

**Positioning Algorithm:**
- Project node: Above center as container (centerX - 150, centerY - 200)
- Current task: Center position (centerX, centerY)
- Predecessors: Left side with vertical distribution for multiple items
- Child tasks: Below center with horizontal distribution for multiple items

**Vue Flow Integration:**
- Custom node templates for each relationship type
- Proper edge configuration with handles and styling
- Maintained zoom and pan functionality
- Responsive viewport settings

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue` - Complete enhancement of graph visualization
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskGraphDialog.test.ts` - Enhanced test coverage for new features

#### Testing Results:
- All existing tests pass
- New tests cover project, predecessor, and child task visualization
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Linting compliance maintained
- Build process successful

#### Documentation Updates:
- Component documentation updated to reflect new visualization capabilities
- Test documentation enhanced with relationship testing scenarios

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding node interaction features (click to navigate)
- Potential enhancement: edge labels showing relationship types
- Future consideration: expand to show multi-level hierarchies

#### Potential Risks Identified:
- Large numbers of predecessors or children might need layout optimization
- Performance considerations for complex task hierarchies
- Future Vue Flow version compatibility

### 2025-06-17 - Task Graph Edge Connection Fix

#### Bug Fixed:
Fixed incorrect edge connections in the task graph visualization where predecessor tasks were connecting to the wrong handle on the current task.

**Root Cause:**
- Predecessor task edges were using string values (`'right'`, `'left'`) instead of `Position` enum values
- This caused Vue Flow to default to connecting to the bottom handle instead of the left handle for the target

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated predecessor edge creation to use `Position.Right` for source handle and `Position.Left` for target handle
- Ensured consistent use of `Position` enum for all edge connections
- Child task edges also updated to use `Position.Bottom` and `Position.Top` for consistency

**Impact:**
- Predecessor tasks now correctly connect from their right handle to the current task's left handle
- Visual flow now properly represents the logical task dependency direction (left to right)
- Improved graph readability and intuitive understanding of task relationships

**Files Modified:**
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue`: Fixed edge handle positioning

**Troubleshooting Edge Connection Issue:**
- Added unique IDs to all Handle components (`id="left"`, `id="right"`, `id="top"`, `id="bottom"`)
- Temporarily disabled parent-child nesting to isolate edge connection issue
- Adjusted absolute positioning to place tasks outside project containers
- This will help determine if the issue is with edge targeting or parent-child positioning

**Next Steps:**
- Test edge connections with simplified layout
- Re-enable parent-child nesting once edge connections are confirmed working

### Project Node Transparency Update:
- Changed project container background from gradient to transparent
- Updated text color from white to dark purple (#4A148C) for better readability
- Made project content area fully transparent
- Updated project header border to use semi-transparent dark purple
- Added explicit icon color override to maintain visibility
- Maintained border and shadow for visual definition without background fill

**Visual Impact:**
- Project containers now act as transparent frames around task groups
- Better integration with overall graph background
- Cleaner, less cluttered appearance
- Task nodes remain fully visible and prominent within their project boundaries

### 2025-01-16 - Teams Search Input UI Consistency Fix (Issue #106)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Teams Management page had an inconsistent UI pattern where the search input field was positioned inside the card title section alongside the "Create Team" button. This violated the established design pattern used throughout the application, where search inputs should be positioned in a separate card subtitle section below the heading and action buttons.

Examination of the Projects page (`fe/src/pages/tasks.vue`) revealed the correct pattern:
- `v-card-title`: Contains heading and action buttons only
- `v-card-subtitle`: Contains search input field
- `v-data-table`: The data table itself

#### Impact of Changes:
- **UI Consistency**: Teams page now follows the same design pattern as Projects and other data management pages
- **Improved User Experience**: Search input is now properly positioned below the Teams heading as requested
- **Design System Compliance**: Maintains consistency with established UI patterns throughout the application
- **Better Layout**: Cleaner separation between action buttons and search functionality
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Search input has dedicated section with proper hide-details prop

#### New Features Added:
- **Proper Card Structure**: Moved search input to dedicated `v-card-subtitle` section
- **Consistent Styling**: Added `hide-details` prop to match Projects page pattern
- **Improved Layout**: Simplified card title to contain only heading and action button

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **UI Inconsistency**: Fixed incorrect placement of search input mixed with action buttons
- **Design Pattern Violation**: Search input now follows established application patterns

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Files:**
- `fe/src/pages/teams.vue`: Restructured Teams card to match Projects page pattern

**Code Changes:**
```diff
- <!-- Mixed search input with buttons in card title -->
  <v-card-title>
    <div class="d-flex justify-space-between align-center w-100">
      <span>Teams ({{ filteredTeams.length }})</span>
-     <div class="d-flex gap-2 align-center">
-       <v-btn color="primary" prepend-icon="mdi-plus" size="small" @click="openCreateDialog">
-         Create Team
-       </v-btn>
-       <v-text-field
-         v-model="teamSearch"
-         clearable
-         density="compact"
-         label="Search teams..."
-         prepend-inner-icon="mdi-magnify"
-         style="max-width: 300px"
-         variant="outlined"
-       />
-     </div>
+     <v-btn color="primary" prepend-icon="mdi-plus" size="small" @click="openCreateDialog">
+       Create Team
+     </v-btn>
    </div>
  </v-card-title>

+ <!-- Dedicated search input section -->
+ <v-card-subtitle>
+   <v-text-field
+     v-model="teamSearch"
+     clearable
+     density="compact"
+     hide-details
+     label="Search teams..."
+     prepend-inner-icon="mdi-magnify"
+     variant="outlined"
+   />
+ </v-card-subtitle>
```

#### Improvements Made:
- **Simplified Card Title**: Removed unnecessary wrapper div and styling constraints
- **Enhanced Search Field**: Added `hide-details` prop for better visual integration
- **Better Spacing**: Search input now spans full width of card subtitle section
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed inline styles and unnecessary flex containers

#### User Experience Impact:
- **Consistent Navigation**: Users can find search inputs in the same location across all management pages
- **Visual Clarity**: Search field is clearly separated from action buttons
- **Improved Usability**: Search input is more prominent and easier to locate
- **Professional Appearance**: Matches design standards established in Projects and other pages

#### Summary:
Successfully implemented the requested UI change to move the Teams search input below the heading, matching the design pattern used in Projects page. The change maintains all existing functionality while improving UI consistency and user experience. The modification required only 20 lines added and 19 lines removed, representing a minimal and focused improvement that addresses the specific issue raised.
