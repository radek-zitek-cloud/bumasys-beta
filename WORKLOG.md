### 2025-01-16 - Creator Display in Task Report Lists (Completed Issue #104)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Task Details page was missing creator information in the lists of status reports and progress reports. While the creator functionality was fully implemented in the backend and creation dialogs (as part of issue #102), the report lists only displayed date and content (summary/notes) without showing who created each report. Users needed visibility into report authorship for better accountability and traceability.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Report lists now display creator information alongside existing content
- **Improved Accountability**: Users can easily identify who created each report
- **Consistent Information Architecture**: Creator information follows established design patterns
- **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful handling of existing reports without creator information
- **Minimal UI Changes**: Non-disruptive integration that maintains existing layouts

#### New Features Added:
- **Creator Display in Progress Reports**: Shows "Creator: FirstName LastName" with account icon
- **Creator Display in Status Reports**: Shows "Creator: FirstName LastName" with account icon  
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only displays creator information when available
- **GraphQL Data Enhancement**: Extended query to fetch creator staff details

#### Technical Implementation:

**GraphQL Query Enhancement:**
- Enhanced `getTaskWithManagementData` query in `fe/src/services/tasks.ts`
- Added `creatorId` and `creator` fields to both report types
- Included staff details: id, firstName, lastName, email

**UI Component Updates:**
- Modified report list items in `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue`
- Added creator information as small caption text below main content
- Used conditional rendering with `v-if="report.creator"`
- Maintained existing prepend/append action button layouts

#### Code Quality:
- **Minimal Changes**: Only 2 files modified with targeted enhancements
- **Consistent Styling**: Used existing Vuetify design tokens and patterns
- **Type Safety**: Leveraged existing TypeScript interfaces
- **Linting Compliance**: All changes pass ESLint validation
- **Test Coverage**: Existing test suite continues to pass

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/services/tasks.ts` - Enhanced GraphQL query for creator data
- `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue` - Added creator display in both report lists

#### User Experience Impact:
- **Seamless Integration**: Creator information appears naturally in existing lists
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Creator shown as subtle caption text that doesn't compete with primary content
- **Icon Context**: Account icon provides visual cue for creator information
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality and workflows remain unchanged

This implementation successfully addresses the requirement to display creator information in task report lists while maintaining design consistency and user experience quality. The changes are surgical and focused, adding value without disrupting existing workflows.

### 2025-06-16 - UI Creator Field Implementation for Task Reports (Completed Issue #102)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The backend creator field functionality was already implemented, but the UI components lacked the necessary fields for manual creator selection. Users needed a way to select the report creator from eligible staff members (those assigned to the task or the evaluator) with automatic preset based on their email.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Added intuitive creator selection dropdowns in report creation dialogs
- **Smart Auto-Assignment**: Automatically presets creator when user email matches eligible staff
- **Manual Override Capability**: Users can manually select a different eligible creator
- **Consistent UI Patterns**: Follows established dialog component design patterns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interface definitions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests validate all creator field functionality

#### Technical Implementation:

**Frontend Interface Updates:**
- Enhanced `CreateTaskStatusReportInput` and `CreateTaskProgressInput` to include `creatorId?: string`
- Updated `TaskStatusReport` and `TaskProgress` interfaces to include creator information
- Modified GraphQL mutations to pass `creatorId` parameter to backend

**UI Component Enhancements:**
```vue
<!-- Creator Selection Dropdown -->
<v-select
  v-model="form.creatorId"
  clearable
  item-title="displayName"
  item-value="id"
  :items="staffOptions"
  label="Creator"
  prepend-icon="mdi-account-supervisor"
  variant="outlined"
/>
```

**Eligible Staff Logic:**
- Created computed property to identify eligible staff (assignees + evaluator)
- Prevents duplicate entries when evaluator is also assigned to task
- Formats staff display as "FirstName LastName (email)" for clarity

**Auto-Preset Functionality:**
```typescript
function presetCreator() {
  if (!authStore.user?.email || !props.eligibleStaff) return
  
  const matchingStaff = props.eligibleStaff.find(staff => 
    staff.email.toLowerCase() === authStore.user?.email.toLowerCase()
  )
  
  if (matchingStaff) {
    form.creatorId = matchingStaff.id
  }
}
```

**Component Props Enhancement:**
- Added `eligibleStaff?: Staff[]` prop to both dialog components
- Updated task management page to pass eligible staff data
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing usage

#### New Features Added:
- **Manual Creator Selection**: Dropdown allowing selection from eligible staff members
- **Smart Auto-Preset**: Automatically selects creator when user email matches staff
- **Visual Guidance**: Helper text explaining creator selection rules
- **Eligible Staff Filtering**: Only shows staff assigned to task or evaluator
- **Email-Based Matching**: Case-insensitive email matching for auto-assignment

#### Code Quality Improvements:
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Created test suite validating all creator field functionality
- **Linting Compliance**: Fixed style issues in modified files
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or invalid creator data

#### Testing Coverage:
- Creator dropdown display validation
- Auto-preset logic based on user email matching
- Form submission with creator data inclusion
- Staff options formatting verification
- Edge cases for non-matching emails

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/services/tasks.ts` - Interface and GraphQL mutation updates
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskStatusReportCreateDialog.vue` - Creator field UI
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskProgressCreateDialog.vue` - Creator field UI  
- `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue` - Eligible staff logic and prop passing
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskStatusReportCreateDialog.creator.test.ts` - Unit tests

#### User Experience Impact:
- **Seamless Workflow**: Most users will have creator auto-selected based on their email
- **Flexibility**: Manual override available when needed
- **Clear Guidance**: Helper text explains selection criteria
- **Consistent Design**: Matches other form elements in the application

This implementation successfully bridges the gap between the existing backend creator functionality and the frontend user interface, providing an intuitive and user-friendly way to manage report creators while maintaining all business rules and validation logic.

### 2025-01-03 - Enhanced Task Graph Dialog with Project, Predecessor, and Child Task Visualization

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The TaskGraphDialog component was displaying only a single task node without showing the broader context of task relationships. Users needed to see the task's position within its project hierarchy and understand its dependencies and breakdown structure. The existing implementation lacked visual representation of:
- Project context as a parent container
- Predecessor task dependencies (left-side positioning)
- Child task breakdown structure (bottom positioning)
- Proper edge connections between related nodes

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Task graph now displays comprehensive relationship mapping
- **Improved UX**: Users can visually understand task context and dependencies at a glance
- **Data Utilization**: Leverages existing backend relationship data (predecessors, childTasks, project)
- **Maintainable Code**: Preserved backward compatibility while adding new node types
- **Professional Appearance**: Color-coded nodes with distinct styling for each relationship type

#### New Features Added:
- **Project Node Visualization**: Purple gradient nodes representing the project container
- **Current Task Emphasis**: Blue gradient nodes with emphasized styling for the focal task
- **Predecessor Mapping**: Orange gradient nodes positioned to the left with connecting edges
- **Child Task Hierarchy**: Green gradient nodes positioned below with connecting edges
- **Edge Connections**: Color-coded edges showing relationship flow:
  - Blue edges: predecessor → current task
  - Green edges: current task → child tasks
- **Smart Positioning**: Calculated positioning algorithm for optimal layout
- **Multiple Node Types**: Vue Flow templates for project, currentTask, predecessor, and childTask nodes
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive positioning based on number of relationships

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Limited Context**: Users can now see full task context instead of isolated single node
- **Missing Relationships**: All task relationships are now visualized properly
- **Poor User Experience**: Enhanced graph provides meaningful visual information

#### Improvements Made:
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different node types using color coding
- **User Navigation**: Better understanding of task flow and dependencies
- **Data Integration**: Full utilization of existing GraphQL endpoint `getTaskWithManagementData`
- **Code Quality**: Maintained TypeScript compliance and linting standards
- **Test Coverage**: Enhanced test suite covering new node types and relationships

#### Technical Implementation:

**Enhanced Component Features:**
- Fetches complete task data including relationships via `getTaskWithManagementData`
- Implements smart positioning algorithm for different node types
- Creates Vue Flow elements array with nodes and edges
- Handles edge cases when relationships don't exist
- Maintains proper error handling and loading states

**Node Type Styling:**
```css
/* Project nodes: Purple gradient */
.custom-project-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6A1B9A, #8E24AA); }

/* Current task: Blue gradient (emphasized) */
.custom-current-task-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1976D2, #2196F3); }

/* Predecessors: Orange gradient */
.custom-predecessor-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FF8F00, #FFA726); }

/* Child tasks: Green gradient */
.custom-child-task-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #388E3C, #4CAF50); }
```

**Positioning Algorithm:**
- Project node: Above center as container (centerX - 150, centerY - 200)
- Current task: Center position (centerX, centerY)
- Predecessors: Left side with vertical distribution for multiple items
- Child tasks: Below center with horizontal distribution for multiple items

**Vue Flow Integration:**
- Custom node templates for each relationship type
- Proper edge configuration with handles and styling
- Maintained zoom and pan functionality
- Responsive viewport settings

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue` - Complete enhancement of graph visualization
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskGraphDialog.test.ts` - Enhanced test coverage for new features

#### Testing Results:
- All existing tests pass
- New tests cover project, predecessor, and child task visualization
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Linting compliance maintained
- Build process successful

#### Documentation Updates:
- Component documentation updated to reflect new visualization capabilities
- Test documentation enhanced with relationship testing scenarios

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding node interaction features (click to navigate)
- Potential enhancement: edge labels showing relationship types
- Future consideration: expand to show multi-level hierarchies

#### Potential Risks Identified:
- Large numbers of predecessors or children might need layout optimization
- Performance considerations for complex task hierarchies
- Future Vue Flow version compatibility
