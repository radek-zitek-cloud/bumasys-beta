### 2025-06-17 - Complete Notification Migration to useNotifications

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The application was using a legacy notification system in `App.vue` with a simple v-snackbar approach alongside the more sophisticated `useNotifications` composable. This created inconsistency and maintenance overhead:
1. **Dual Notification Systems**: Legacy `notify()` function and modern `useNotifications` composable coexisted
2. **Inconsistent User Experience**: Different notification styles and behaviors across the application
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Two systems to maintain and update
4. **Missing Features**: Legacy system lacked advanced features like action buttons, queuing, and proper persistence handling

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Unified Notification System**: All notifications now use the `useNotifications` composable
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Consistent notification styling and behavior throughout the application

### 2025-06-17 - App.vue Code Review and Refactoring

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The main `App.vue` component violated several key architectural principles from the coding standards:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Contained extensive authentication logic that should be delegated to composables
2. **Code Duplication**: Direct API calls duplicated functionality already available in the `useAuth` composable
3. **Type Safety**: Missing proper interfaces for function parameters
4. **Performance**: Not leveraging computed properties for reactive calculations
5. **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels and semantic attributes

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Removed ~100 lines of authentication logic from App.vue
- **Improved Maintainability**: Authentication logic now centralized in composables
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all function parameters
- **Better Performance**: Implemented computed properties for reactive calculations

### 2025-06-17 - Admin Menu/Page Implementation (Issue #114)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The existing system had debug information, backend configuration display, and database management functionality scattered across the user menu (triple-dot menu) in the top navigation. This violated the principle of logical grouping and made administrative functions less discoverable. Users needed a centralized location for system administration tasks, and the user menu was becoming cluttered with administrative functions that didn't belong there.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Improved Information Architecture**: Administrative functions now have a dedicated, discoverable location
- **Better User Experience**: Cleaner user menu focused on user-specific actions (profile, password change, logout)
- **Enhanced Administrative Capabilities**: New database backup functionality provides data protection
- **Better Security**: Administrative functions clearly separated from user functions
- **Maintained Existing Functionality**: All existing features preserved while improving organization

#### New Features Added:
1. **Administration Page** (`/fe/src/pages/admin.vue`):
   - Dedicated admin page accessible via `/admin` route
   - Four main sections: Debug Info, Backend Config, Database Management, Database Backup
   - Authentication required for access
   - Clean card-based UI using Vuetify components

2. **Database Backup System**:
   - Backend: Added `backupDatabase` GraphQL mutation
   - Database service methods for creating timestamped backups
   - Frontend service (`/fe/src/services/backup.ts`) for backup operations
   - Backups stored in `/data/backups/` directory with metadata

3. **Navigation Improvements**:
   - Added "Administration" item to sidebar navigation (last item)
   - Uses `mdi-cog-outline` icon with descriptive subtitle
   - Removed Debug Info and BE Config from user menu

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Added `backupDatabase` mutation to GraphQL schema
  - Implemented backup resolver in `database.resolvers.ts`
  - Extended DatabaseService and DatabaseManager with `createBackup()` methods
  - Backup files include both auth and data databases with version metadata

- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Created new admin page reusing existing components (DebugInfoCard, ConfigDisplayCard, DatabaseTagSwitchCard)
  - Updated App.vue navigation items and removed debug/config dialogs
  - New backup service using existing GraphQL client patterns
  - Maintained authentication requirements for all admin functions

#### Improvements Made:
- **Code Reuse**: Leveraged existing components to minimize new code
- **Consistent UI**: Admin page follows established design patterns
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and user notifications for all operations
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for all administrative operations
- **Testing**: Created integration tests for backup functionality

#### Testing Validation:

### Documentation Updates
- Updated WORKLOG.md with this summary.

### TODOs / Follow-up
- Consider enforcing a lint rule to prevent `console.log` in committed test code.
- Continue periodic reviews to maintain test quality.

### Potential Issues or Risks
- None identified; all tests pass and migration logic is preserved.

### 2025-06-17 - Multiple Database System Implementation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The system was using a single database file (db.json) for all data, which made it impossible to separate different environments or work with different datasets. This limitation prevented users from having development, staging, and production data isolation, and mixing authentication data with business data created security and management concerns.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Data Separation**: Authentication data (users, sessions) now stored separately from business data
- **Environment Isolation**: Different database tags allow complete data isolation between environments
- **Enhanced Security**: Authentication data remains consistent while business data can be switched
- **Improved Development Workflow**: Developers can easily switch between different datasets
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work with unified database interface

#### New Features Added:
1. **Multiple Database Architecture**:
   - Split authentication database (`auth.json`) from application data databases (`db-{tag}.json`)
   - DatabaseManager class for handling multiple database instances
   - DatabaseService for unified access with backward compatibility
   - Default tag system starting with "db-default.json"

2. **GraphQL Database Switching**:
   - New `dbtag(tag: String!)` mutation for switching active dataset
   - Tag validation (alphanumeric + hyphens, length limits, reserved names)
   - Authentication required for all database operations
   - Automatic database creation for new tags

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - "Switch Database" option in user menu (triple dot menu)
   - DatabaseTagSwitchCard component with validation and error handling
   - User-friendly tag input with real-time validation
   - Success/error notifications for database operations

4. **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Test utilities for multi-database cleanup
   - 5 new tests specifically for database tag functionality
   - Updated all existing tests to handle new database structure
   - Comprehensive validation of tag switching behavior

#### Database Schema Changes:
- **Before**: Single `db.json` with all data
- **After**: 
  - `auth.json`: users, sessions
  - `db-{tag}.json`: organizations, departments, staff, projects, tasks, etc.

#### Security Enhancements:
- Tag format validation prevents injection attacks
- Reserved tag names protect system integrity  
- Authentication required for all database operations
- Comprehensive logging of database operations

#### Documentation Updates:
- New comprehensive documentation in `docs/MULTIPLE_DATABASES.md`
- API reference for database switching
- Migration guide for existing deployments
- Security considerations and best practices

#### Testing Results:
- All existing tests pass with new database structure
- 5 new tests for database tag functionality (100% pass rate)
- Frontend type checking passes
- Backend compilation successful

#### Performance Considerations:
- Memory usage unchanged (only active tag loaded)
- Atomic file operations for data integrity
- No impact on existing GraphQL operations

#### Migration Path:
- Backward compatible unified database interface maintained
- Gradual migration possible through DatabaseService abstraction
- Clear separation allows for future database technology upgrades

### 2025-06-17 - Dynamic Project Sizing and Parent-Child Nesting Restoration

#### Improvements Made:
**Re-enabled Parent-Child Nesting:**
- Restored `parentNode` and `extent: 'parent'` properties for proper task nesting
- Tasks are now properly contained within their project nodes
- Maintained working edge connections with proper handle targeting

**Dynamic Project Node Sizing:**
- Implemented intelligent project container sizing based on number of contained tasks
- Projects now arrange tasks in a grid layout (roughly square) for optimal space usage
- Dynamic width/height calculation: `projectWidth = max(300, (tasksPerRow * taskWidth) + spacing + padding)`
- Projects automatically resize to fit all their tasks without overflow

**Grid Layout for Tasks Within Projects:**
- Tasks positioned in grid formation within project containers
- Calculated positioning: `taskX = padding + (col * (taskWidth + spacing))`
- Tasks arranged in rows and columns for clean organization
- Header space reserved for project title and metadata

**Improved Styling:**
- Fixed task node dimensions to consistent 200px width × 80px min-height
- Added `overflow: visible` to project content area for proper child visibility
- Consistent spacing and padding throughout the layout
- Project containers have minimum dimensions for proper display

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Dynamic sizing algorithm
const tasksInProject = tasks.length
const tasksPerRow = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(tasksInProject))
const projectWidth = Math.max(300, (tasksPerRow * taskWidth) + spacing + padding)
const projectHeight = Math.max(200, (rows * taskHeight) + spacing + padding + headerHeight)

// Grid positioning within project
const row = Math.floor(taskIndex / tasksPerRow)
const col = taskIndex % tasksPerRow
const taskX = projectPadding + (col * (taskWidth + taskSpacing))
const taskY = projectPadding + 60 + (row * (taskHeight + taskSpacing))
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Tasks properly nested inside project containers
- ✅ Project nodes dynamically resize to fit their content
- ✅ Clean grid layout for multiple tasks within projects
- ✅ Maintained proper edge connections (predecessor: right→left, child: bottom→top)
- ✅ Professional visual hierarchy and organization

### 2025-06-17 - WORKLOG File Organization and Daily Entry Migration

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The main WORKLOG.md file had grown very large with entries spanning multiple dates, making it difficult to navigate and find specific changes. The file contained comprehensive daily entries that would benefit from better organization by date for improved maintainability and readability.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Improved Organization**: WORKLOG entries now organized into separate date-based files
- **Better Navigation**: Each date has its own dedicated file for easier reference
- **Reduced File Size**: Main WORKLOG.md is now smaller and more focused
- **Historical Preservation**: All original content preserved in appropriate date files
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Future WORKLOG entries can follow the established date-based pattern

#### New Features Added:
- **Date-Based WORKLOG Files**:
  - `WORKLOG 20250617.md`: June 17, 2025 entries (3 entries covering project nesting, edge connections, and UI improvements)
  - `WORKLOG 20250616.md`: June 16, 2025 entries (7 entries covering task graphs, reports, and UI enhancements)

- **Enhanced Existing Files**: Added remaining entries to `WORKLOG 20250616.md` and `WORKLOG 20250116.md`
- **Organized by Date**: All entries moved to their appropriate date-based files
- **Maintained Structure**: Each file follows consistent format with proper headers and sections

#### Documentation Structure:
Each date-based WORKLOG file follows the same structure:
- Clear date-based filename format: `WORKLOG YYYYMMDD.md`
- Consistent header format: `# WORKLOG YYYYMMDD.md`
- Date-specific subtitle: `## Change Log for [Month Day, Year]`
- All original entry content preserved exactly as written
- Proper markdown formatting maintained throughout

#### Benefits Achieved:
- **Faster Navigation**: Users can quickly find entries by date
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Smaller files are easier to read and comprehend
- **Better Version Control**: Changes to specific dates won't affect other date entries
- **Scalable Organization**: Pattern established for future WORKLOG organization
- **Historical Access**: Complete change history preserved and easily accessible

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Continue using this pattern for future WORKLOG entries
- Consider monthly organization if individual date files become too large
- Monitor file sizes to determine if further subdivision becomes necessary

#### Summary:
Successfully reorganized WORKLOG entries from a single large file into 6 date-based files covering all entries from January 15, 2025 through June 17, 2025. This reorganization improves navigability while preserving all historical information and establishing a scalable pattern for future WORKLOG management.

## 2025-01-19 - Database Switching Behavior Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis
**Question**: When the backend switches database, does it flush all in-memory data and reread data from new database?

**Answer**: **YES** - Complete data flush and reload occurs

### Analysis Summary

#### Database Switching Process (`DatabaseManager.switchToTag()`)
1. **Complete Instance Replacement**: 
   - `this.dataDb = await this.createDataDatabase(tag);` creates entirely new database instance
   - Old database instance is discarded (garbage collected)

2. **Fresh Data Loading**:
   - `createDataDatabase()` reads JSON file from disk using `fs.readFileSync()`
   - Data is freshly parsed with `JSON.parse(rawData)`
   - No caching or persistence of old data occurs

3. **Immediate Service Impact**:
   - All services access data via unified database interface with dynamic getters
   - Services immediately see new data through `dataDb.data.{entity}` references
   - No service restart or re-initialization required

#### Key Technical Details
- **Authentication data**: Remains unchanged (separate `authDb` instance)
- **Application data**: Completely replaced from new database file
- **Memory management**: Direct file-based approach with no caching layers
- **Access pattern**: Services use direct references to `this.db.data.{entity}` arrays

#### Impact Assessment
- ✅ **Data Consistency**: Complete isolation between database tags
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Old data is properly garbage collected
- ✅ **Performance**: Switching is atomic but requires full file read
- ✅ **Reliability**: No stale data or cache invalidation issues

### Implementation Files Analyzed
- `/be/src/utils/database-manager.utils.ts` - Core switching logic
- `/be/src/services/database.service.ts` - Unified database interface
- `/be/src/services/*.service.ts` - Service layer data access patterns
- `/be/src/resolvers/database.resolvers.ts` - GraphQL interface for switching

### Conclusions
The database switching mechanism provides complete data isolation with immediate effect. When switching tags:
1. All in-memory application data is flushed
2. New data is read fresh from the target database file
3. Services immediately access the new dataset
4. No data persistence or caching issues exist

This design ensures clean separation between different database environments/tags.

# Development Worklog

## 2025-06-17 - Database Switching Fix - Critical Bug Resolution

### Root Cause Analysis
**Issue**: Database switching was not working - frontend still showed data from previous database after switching tags.

**Root Cause**: The `getUnifiedDatabase()` method in `DatabaseService` was capturing database references at object creation time instead of dynamically accessing current instances.

### Problem Details
1. **Services held stale references**: Services were initialized with a unified database object that captured `authDb` and `dataDb` references
2. **No refresh after switching**: When `switchToTag()` changed `this.dataDb` to a new instance, the unified database object still referenced the old instance
3. **Data persistence illusion**: Services continued to see old data because they accessed stale database references

### Technical Fix Applied

#### Modified: `/be/src/services/database.service.ts`
**Before**:
```typescript
getUnifiedDatabase(): Database {
  const authDb = this.dbManager.getAuthDatabase();  // Captured once
  const dataDb = this.dbManager.getDataDatabase();  // Captured once
  
  return {
    get data() {
      return { /* uses captured references */ };
    }
  };
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
getUnifiedDatabase(): Database {
  const dbManager = this.dbManager; // Capture manager reference
  
  return {
    get data() {
      // Dynamically get current instances on each access
      const authDb = dbManager.getAuthDatabase();
      const dataDb = dbManager.getDataDatabase();
      return { /* uses current references */ };
    }
  };
}
```

#### Enhanced: `/be/src/utils/database-manager.utils.ts`
- Added detailed logging to track database switching behavior
- Added data count verification before/after switching

### Impact Assessment
- ✅ **Data Isolation**: Complete separation between database tags
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of old database instances  
- ✅ **Service Refresh**: All services immediately see new data after switching
- ✅ **Bi-directional**: Switching back restores original data correctly

### Testing & Verification

#### Created: `/be/tests/database-switching-behavior.test.ts`
Comprehensive test suite verifying:
1. Data from previous database disappears after switching
2. Each database tag maintains isolated data
3. Departments and organizations switch correctly
4. Bi-directional switching preserves data integrity

**Test Results**: ✅ All tests passing

### Debugging Process
1. **Initial Analysis**: Traced code flow through database manager and service layer
2. **Log Analysis**: Added logging to identify where references were captured
3. **Test Creation**: Built comprehensive test to verify actual vs expected behavior
4. **Root Cause**: Found closure capturing stale references in unified database
5. **Fix Implementation**: Made data access dynamic instead of static
6. **Verification**: Tests confirm complete data isolation between tags

### Lessons Learned
- **Closure Gotcha**: JavaScript closures can capture references that become stale
- **Dynamic Access**: Getters should access current state, not captured state
- **Test Coverage**: Need integration tests for state-changing operations
- **Logging Value**: Detailed logging helped identify the exact failure point

### Follow-up Actions
- ✅ Database switching now works correctly
- ✅ Frontend will see proper data isolation between database tags
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for database switching scenarios

## 2025-06-17 - Health Query Enhancement: Database Tag Information

### Feature Enhancement
**Added**: Current database tag information to GraphQL health query response

### Implementation Details

#### New GraphQL Schema Field
**Added to Query type**:
```graphql
"""
Get the current database tag in use
Returns the tag name of the currently active database
"""
databaseTag: String!
```

#### Modified Files

##### `/be/src/schema/index.ts`
- Added `databaseTag: String!` field to Query type
- Fixed missing `teamMembers(teamId: ID!): [TeamMember!]!` query field

##### `/be/src/resolvers/health.resolvers.ts`
- Updated `setServices()` to accept database service parameter
- Added `databaseTag` resolver that returns current database tag
- Enhanced logging for database tag operations

##### `/be/src/resolvers/index.ts`
- Updated `setHealthServices()` call to pass database service

### Technical Implementation

#### Resolver Logic
```typescript
databaseTag: (): string => {
  logger.debug({ operation: 'databaseTag' }, 'Getting current database tag');
  const tag = databaseService?.getCurrentTag() || 'default';
  logger.info({ operation: 'databaseTag', tag }, 'Database tag retrieved');
  return tag;
}
```

#### Service Integration
- Health resolvers now receive both UserService and DatabaseService
- Database tag is accessible without authentication (public information)
- Falls back to 'default' if database service unavailable

### Testing & Verification

#### Created: `/be/tests/health-database-tag.test.ts`
Comprehensive test coverage:
1. ✅ Returns current database tag in health query
2. ✅ Database tag changes when switching databases  
3. ✅ Database tag accessible without authentication

#### Test Results
- All new tests passing
- Existing health tests continue to pass
- No regression in existing functionality

### Frontend Integration
Frontend can now query the current database tag:

```graphql
query {
  health
  databaseTag
}
```

This provides real-time visibility into which database environment is currently active.

### Bug Fix: Missing Schema Definition
**Fixed**: `teamMembers` query resolver had no corresponding schema definition
- Added missing `teamMembers(teamId: ID!): [TeamMember!]!` to schema
- Resolved GraphQL server startup error

### Benefits
- ✅ **Transparency**: Frontend shows which database tag is active
- ✅ **Debugging**: Easy verification of database switching
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Health checks include database environment info
- ✅ **Public Access**: No authentication required for database tag info

### 2025-06-17 - Task Graph Display Improvements

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The existing TaskGraphDialog component had a basic visualization of task relationships using Vue Flow, but lacked advanced visual features that would help users better understand task status, priorities, progress, and relationships. The graph was functional but not visually informative enough for effective project management.

#### Impact of Changes:

   - Color-coded status indicators on task nodes (green=completed, blue=in-progress, etc.)
   - Dynamic task icons based on status (play icon for in-progress, check for completed)
   - Status-based border colors for immediate visual feedback

2. **Priority Visualization**:
   - Priority badges in top-left corner of task nodes
   - Color coding: green=low, orange=medium, red=high, pulsing red=critical
   - Icon-based priority indicators (!,!!,!!!, ⚠)

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Progress bars showing task completion percentage
   - Status-based progress calculation
   - Visual progress indicators with percentage text

4. **Interactive Graph Controls**:
   - Filter chips to show/hide predecessors and child tasks
   - Zoom in/out controls
   - Fit-to-view functionality  
   - Refresh graph button
   - Toggle minimap option (prepared for future enhancement)

5. **Enhanced Task Information**:
   - Date information display (planned start dates)
   - Evaluator information
   - Project names and task complexity
   - Better typography and spacing

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Enhanced Node Templates**: Updated currentTask, predecessor, and childTask node templates with rich information display

- **Graph State Management**: Implemented visibility filtering based on user selections
- **TypeScript Improvements**: Added proper type definitions for mappings and resolved type errors
- **CSS Enhancements**: Added comprehensive styling for status indicators, priority badges, progress bars, and responsive design

#### Improvements Made:
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between current task, predecessors, and child tasks
- **Information Density**: Balanced information display without overwhelming the interface
- **Accessibility**: Color coding combined with icons and text for better accessibility
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering and update mechanisms
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured utility functions and clear component organization

#### Follow-up TODOs:

- Implement click-to-navigate functionality to task details
- Add animation transitions for node visibility changes
- Consider implementing node clustering for large graphs
- Add export functionality for graph visualization

#### Recent Layout Improvements (June 17, 2025):
- **Hierarchical Layout Structure**: Implemented requested layout with predecessors on the left, current task in center, and child tasks below extending right
- **Improved Project Container Sizing**: Project nodes now properly encompass all contained task nodes with appropriate padding
- **Optimized Task Spacing**: Set task spacing to half the node width (100px) for better visual balance
- **Enhanced Edge Styling**: Fixed Vue Flow edge type compatibility by using default edge type with custom styling (dashed lines for predecessors, solid for child tasks)
- **Better Proportions**: Increased task node minimum height to 100px and ensured consistent 200px width across all node types
- **Vue Flow Compatibility Fix**: Resolved "[Vue Flow]: Edge type is missing" error by removing explicit edge type and using Vue Flow defaults
- **Project Node Sizing Fix**: Fixed project container dimensions by properly configuring Vue Flow node style properties with px units and adding CSS overrides to ensure dynamic sizing works correctly

#### Potential Issues/Risks:
- Vue Flow component imports need to be verified for available features
- Large graphs may need performance optimization
- Mobile responsiveness may need additional testing
- Filter state persistence across dialog reopening
