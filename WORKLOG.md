### 2025-01-03 - Enhanced Task Graph Dialog with Project, Predecessor, and Child Task Visualization

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The TaskGraphDialog component was displaying only a single task node without showing the broader context of task relationships. Users needed to see the task's position within its project hierarchy and understand its dependencies and breakdown structure. The existing implementation lacked visual representation of:
- Project context as a parent container
- Predecessor task dependencies (left-side positioning)
- Child task breakdown structure (bottom positioning)
- Proper edge connections between related nodes

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Task graph now displays comprehensive relationship mapping
- **Improved UX**: Users can visually understand task context and dependencies at a glance
- **Data Utilization**: Leverages existing backend relationship data (predecessors, childTasks, project)
- **Maintainable Code**: Preserved backward compatibility while adding new node types
- **Professional Appearance**: Color-coded nodes with distinct styling for each relationship type

#### New Features Added:
- **Project Node Visualization**: Purple gradient nodes representing the project container
- **Current Task Emphasis**: Blue gradient nodes with emphasized styling for the focal task
- **Predecessor Mapping**: Orange gradient nodes positioned to the left with connecting edges
- **Child Task Hierarchy**: Green gradient nodes positioned below with connecting edges
- **Edge Connections**: Color-coded edges showing relationship flow:
  - Blue edges: predecessor → current task
  - Green edges: current task → child tasks
- **Smart Positioning**: Calculated positioning algorithm for optimal layout
- **Multiple Node Types**: Vue Flow templates for project, currentTask, predecessor, and childTask nodes
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive positioning based on number of relationships

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Limited Context**: Users can now see full task context instead of isolated single node
- **Missing Relationships**: All task relationships are now visualized properly
- **Poor User Experience**: Enhanced graph provides meaningful visual information

#### Improvements Made:
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different node types using color coding
- **User Navigation**: Better understanding of task flow and dependencies
- **Data Integration**: Full utilization of existing GraphQL endpoint `getTaskWithManagementData`
- **Code Quality**: Maintained TypeScript compliance and linting standards
- **Test Coverage**: Enhanced test suite covering new node types and relationships

#### Technical Implementation:

**Enhanced Component Features:**
- Fetches complete task data including relationships via `getTaskWithManagementData`
- Implements smart positioning algorithm for different node types
- Creates Vue Flow elements array with nodes and edges
- Handles edge cases when relationships don't exist
- Maintains proper error handling and loading states

**Node Type Styling:**
```css
/* Project nodes: Purple gradient */
.custom-project-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6A1B9A, #8E24AA); }

/* Current task: Blue gradient (emphasized) */
.custom-current-task-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1976D2, #2196F3); }

/* Predecessors: Orange gradient */
.custom-predecessor-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FF8F00, #FFA726); }

/* Child tasks: Green gradient */
.custom-child-task-node { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #388E3C, #4CAF50); }
```

**Positioning Algorithm:**
- Project node: Above center as container (centerX - 150, centerY - 200)
- Current task: Center position (centerX, centerY)
- Predecessors: Left side with vertical distribution for multiple items
- Child tasks: Below center with horizontal distribution for multiple items

**Vue Flow Integration:**
- Custom node templates for each relationship type
- Proper edge configuration with handles and styling
- Maintained zoom and pan functionality
- Responsive viewport settings

#### Files Modified:
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue` - Complete enhancement of graph visualization
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskGraphDialog.test.ts` - Enhanced test coverage for new features

#### Testing Results:
- All existing tests pass
- New tests cover project, predecessor, and child task visualization
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Linting compliance maintained
- Build process successful

#### Documentation Updates:
- Component documentation updated to reflect new visualization capabilities
- Test documentation enhanced with relationship testing scenarios

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding node interaction features (click to navigate)
- Potential enhancement: edge labels showing relationship types
- Future consideration: expand to show multi-level hierarchies

#### Potential Risks Identified:
- Large numbers of predecessors or children might need layout optimization
- Performance considerations for complex task hierarchies
- Future Vue Flow version compatibility

### 2025-06-16 - Task Status Report and Progress Report Creator Staff Implementation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The system required modification of Task Status Report and Progress Report entities to include a creator Staff field. When these reports are created, a report creator needs to be set who is one of the Staff assigned to the Task or the evaluator of the Task. The requirement was to auto-detect the creator when the logged-in user's email matches one of the eligible staff members.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Data Model Enhancement**: Added `creatorId` field to both TaskStatusReport and TaskProgress interfaces
- **GraphQL Schema Update**: Enhanced schema to include creator field and Staff relationship
- **Auto-Assignment Logic**: Implemented automatic creator assignment based on user email matching
- **Authorization Validation**: Added validation to ensure creators are authorized (assigned to task or evaluator)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing API compatibility with optional creator field
- **Field Resolvers**: Added GraphQL field resolvers for creator Staff relationships

#### New Features Added:
- **Creator Auto-Assignment**: Automatically assigns creator when logged-in user email matches eligible staff
- **Authorization Validation**: Validates that creator is either assigned to task or is the evaluator
- **GraphQL Relationships**: Added creator field with Staff relationship in GraphQL schema
- **Optional Override**: Allows explicit creator assignment with validation

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Missing Creator Tracking**: Reports now properly track who created them
- **Authorization Gap**: Ensures only authorized staff can be set as creators

#### Improvements Made:
- **User Experience**: Seamless creator assignment without manual selection in most cases
- **Data Integrity**: Enforced business rules for report creator assignment
- **API Enhancement**: Extended GraphQL mutations to support optional creator parameter

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Interfaces:**
- `TaskStatusReport`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field
- `TaskProgress`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field
- `CreateTaskStatusReportInput`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field
- `CreateTaskProgressInput`: Added optional `creatorId?: string` field

**GraphQL Schema Changes:**
```diff
type TaskStatusReport {
  id: ID!
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  statusSummary: String
+ creatorId: ID
  task: Task!
+ creator: Staff
}

type TaskProgress {
  id: ID!
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  progressPercent: Int!
  notes: String
+ creatorId: ID
  task: Task!
+ creator: Staff
}

// Mutation input updates
createTaskStatusReport(
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  statusSummary: String
+ creatorId: ID
): TaskStatusReport!

createTaskProgress(
  taskId: ID!
  reportDate: String!
  progressPercent: Int!
  notes: String
+ creatorId: ID
): TaskProgress!
```

**Service Layer Enhancements:**
- Enhanced `TaskProgressService.createTaskProgress()` to accept `userEmail` parameter
- Enhanced `TaskStatusReportService.createTaskStatusReport()` to accept `userEmail` parameter
- Added creator auto-assignment logic based on user email matching
- Added authorization validation for explicit creator assignments

**Resolver Updates:**
- Updated task resolvers to pass user email to services for auto-assignment
- Added field resolvers for creator Staff relationships

**Creator Assignment Logic:**
1. If no explicit creator provided, check if user email matches any staff
2. If match found, validate staff is assigned to task OR is evaluator
3. If valid, auto-assign as creator
4. If explicit creator provided, validate they are authorized
5. Allow creation without creator if no valid assignment possible

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated interface documentation to describe creator fields
- Added JSDoc comments for new service method parameters
- Enhanced GraphQL schema documentation for creator relationships

#### Tests Added:
- **Creator Auto-Assignment Tests**: 8 new test cases for TaskProgressService
- **Creator Validation Tests**: 8 new test cases for TaskStatusReportService
- **Authorization Tests**: Tests for valid and invalid creator assignments
- **Edge Case Tests**: Tests for scenarios without user email or explicit creator

#### Test Coverage:
- All existing tests continue to pass (381 total tests)
- 16 new tests added specifically for creator functionality
- 100% coverage of new creator assignment logic paths

#### Potential Issues or Risks Identified:
- **Migration**: Existing reports will have `creatorId` as `undefined` - this is expected and handled
- **Performance**: Field resolvers add database lookups for creator - minimal impact expected
- **API Changes**: New optional fields are backward compatible

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding creator tracking to project status reports if needed
- Monitor performance of creator field resolver queries
- Consider adding creator audit trail for report modifications

### 2025-01-16 - Task Graph Display Feature Implementation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The system needed a graphical display of task relationships to improve task management visibility. The issue requested a "Display Graph" button on the task management page that would open a dialog showing task relationships using Vue Flow. This was a new feature implementation rather than a bug fix.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **New Feature Added**: Task Graph visualization using Vue Flow library
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can now visualize task relationships in a graphical format
- **Consistent UI Pattern**: New dialog follows the same design patterns as existing dialogs (StaffTreeDialog, DepartmentTreeDialog)
- **Minimal Scope**: Initially displays only the current task as a single node (as requested)
- **Future Extensible**: Architecture supports future expansion to show predecessors, successors, and child tasks

#### New Features Added:
- **Task Graph Dialog**: New Vue Flow-based component for displaying task relationships
- **Display Graph Button**: Added button to task management page header with proper tooltip
- **Vue Flow Integration**: Installed and configured Vue Flow library for graph visualization

#### Technical Changes:

**New Dependencies Added:**
- `@vue-flow/core`: Core Vue Flow library for graph visualization
- `@vue-flow/controls`: Additional controls for Vue Flow
- `@vue-flow/minimap`: Minimap component for Vue Flow

**New Files Created:**
- `fe/src/components/tasks/TaskGraphDialog.vue`: Main task graph dialog component
- `fe/tests/unit/components/TaskGraphDialog.test.ts`: Unit tests for the component

**Modified Files:**
- `fe/src/pages/task-management/[id].vue`: Added Display Graph button and dialog integration
- `fe/package.json`: Added Vue Flow dependencies
- `fe/src/components.d.ts`: Auto-generated component declarations

**Code Changes:**
```diff
// In task management page header:
+ <v-btn
+   color="white"
+   icon="mdi-graph"
+   size="small"
+   variant="text"
+   @click="openTaskGraphDialog"
+ >
+   <v-icon>mdi-graph</v-icon>
+   <v-tooltip activator="parent" location="bottom">Display Graph</v-tooltip>
+ </v-btn>

// New dialog component:
+ <v-dialog v-model="showTaskGraphDialog" fullscreen persistent>
+   <TaskGraphDialog
+     v-if="task"
+     :task="task"
+     @close="showTaskGraphDialog = false"
+   />
+ </v-dialog>
```

#### Implementation Details:
- **Single Node Display**: Initially shows only the current task as a single node with task name and project
- **Responsive Design**: Dialog takes most of the screen space (90vw x 80vh)
- **Consistent Styling**: Follows Vuetify design patterns with primary colors
- **Error Handling**: Includes loading states and error handling
- **Vue Flow Features**: Includes zoom, pan, and basic interactivity

#### Testing:

#### TODOs and Follow-up Tasks:
- Future enhancement: Add predecessor/successor task nodes
- Future enhancement: Add child task nodes
- Future enhancement: Add interactive node actions
- Future enhancement: Add different node types/colors for different task statuses
- Future enhancement: Add edge connections between related tasks

#### Potential Issues or Risks Identified:
- Vue Flow requires ResizeObserver which may not be available in all test environments
- Component may need performance optimization for large task graphs in future
- Current implementation is basic; complex graphs may require additional UI/UX considerations

### 2025-01-16 - Teams Participants Filtering Bug Fix

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Teams Management page had a critical bug where after adding, updating, or removing team members, the members list would reload with members from ALL teams instead of maintaining the filter for the currently selected team. This occurred because the team member management functions were calling both `loadTeamMembers(selectedTeamForMembers.value.id)` (correct - loads specific team's members) and `loadAllTeamMembers()` (incorrect - overwrites with all team members), causing the UI to lose the team-specific filtering.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Fixed Team Member Filtering**: When managing a specific team's members, only that team's members are now displayed after CRUD operations
- **Improved User Experience**: Users can now safely add/edit/remove team members without losing context of which team they're working with
- **Maintained Data Integrity**: Team member operations continue to work correctly while preserving proper UI state
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact with minimal code modifications

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Team Participants Filter Loss**: Fixed issue where team member lists would show members from all teams after add/update/remove operations
- **UI State Management**: Maintained proper filtering context during team member management operations

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Files:**
- `fe/src/pages/teams.vue`: Removed unnecessary `loadAllTeamMembers()` calls from team member management functions

**Code Changes:**
```diff
// In handleAddTeamMember function:
  if (selectedTeamForMembers.value) {
    await loadTeamMembers(selectedTeamForMembers.value.id)
  }
- await loadAllTeamMembers()

// In handleUpdateTeamMember function:
  if (selectedTeamForMembers.value) {
    await loadTeamMembers(selectedTeamForMembers.value.id)
  }
- await loadAllTeamMembers()

// In handleRemoveTeamMember function:
  if (selectedTeamForMembers.value) {
    await loadTeamMembers(selectedTeamForMembers.value.id)
  }
- await loadAllTeamMembers()
```

#### New Features Added:
- None (bug fix only)

#### Improvements Made:
- **Surgical Code Changes**: Only 3 lines removed, 0 lines added - minimal impact approach
- **Preserved Existing Functionality**: All existing team management features continue to work as expected
- **Enhanced UI Consistency**: Team member filtering now behaves predictably across all operations

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated WORKLOG.md with detailed analysis of the filtering bug and its resolution

#### Testing Results:
- **All Existing Tests Pass**: 271 tests pass with no regressions introduced
- **No Linting Errors**: No new linting issues introduced by the changes
- **Minimal Change Validation**: Only 3 lines deleted, 0 lines added - confirms surgical approach

#### Potential Issues or Risks Identified:
- **Team Member Count Display**: The team member count chips in the main teams table might become slightly stale until the page is refreshed, but this is a minor UI issue compared to the critical filtering bug that was fixed
- **Performance Impact**: Positive - eliminated unnecessary loading of all team members during specific team operations

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Monitor user feedback to ensure the fix resolves the reported issue completely
- Consider implementing real-time team member count updates if the stale count becomes problematic

### 2025-01-16 - Teams Page UI Consistency: Move Create Team Button to Card

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Teams Management page had an inconsistent UI pattern where the "Create Team" button was positioned in the page header (outside the main data card), while all other data maintenance pages in the application follow a consistent pattern of placing action buttons inside the card titles. This inconsistency affected user experience and violated the established design system patterns used throughout the application.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **UI Consistency**: Teams page now follows the same design pattern as other data management pages (References, People, etc.)
- **Improved User Experience**: Users can now find action buttons in a consistent location across all data management interfaces
- **Design System Compliance**: Maintains consistency with established UI patterns throughout the application
- **Responsive Layout**: Better utilization of card space and improved mobile responsiveness

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **UI Inconsistency**: Fixed inconsistent placement of Create Team button by moving it from page header to card title section

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Files:**
- `fe/src/pages/teams.vue`: Moved Create Team button from page header to Teams card title section

**Code Changes:**
```diff
- <!-- Page Header with Create Team button -->
- <div class="d-flex justify-space-between align-center mb-6">
-   <div>
-     <h1 class="text-h4 mb-2">Teams Management</h1>
-     <p class="text-subtitle-1 text-medium-emphasis">
-       Manage teams and team member assignments
-     </p>
-   </div>
-   <v-btn
-     color="primary"
-     prepend-icon="mdi-account-multiple-plus"
-     @click="openCreateDialog"
-   >
-     Create Team
-   </v-btn>
- </div>

+ <!-- Simplified Page Header -->
+ <div class="mb-6">
+   <h1 class="text-h4 mb-2">Teams Management</h1>
+   <p class="text-subtitle-1 text-medium-emphasis">
+     Manage teams and team member assignments
+   </p>
+ </div>

  <!-- Teams Table with integrated Create button -->
  <v-card-title>
    <div class="d-flex justify-space-between align-center w-100">
      <span>Teams ({{ filteredTeams.length }})</span>
-     <v-text-field ... />
+     <div class="d-flex gap-2 align-center">
+       <v-btn
+         color="primary"
+         prepend-icon="mdi-plus"
+         size="small"
+         @click="openCreateDialog"
+       >
+         Create Team
+       </v-btn>
+       <v-text-field ... />
+     </div>
    </div>
  </v-card-title>
```

#### Design Pattern Consistency:
- Changed button icon from `mdi-account-multiple-plus` to `mdi-plus` to match other pages
- Added `size="small"` to match the styling used in References and People pages  
- Positioned button before the search field in the card title section
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving visual consistency

#### Validation:
- ✅ Type checking passes
- ✅ Build completes successfully  
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ No functional changes - only UI positioning

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider standardizing this pattern across any remaining pages that might have similar inconsistencies
- Document this UI pattern in the component library or design system documentation

### 2025-01-16 - Staff Organization Chart Fix: Display Hierarchy from Selected Staff Member

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The Staff Organization Chart (Staff Tree Dialog) was always displaying the complete organizational hierarchy starting from the highest-level manager (root staff member), regardless of which staff member was selected. This occurred because the `findRootStaff` function was traversing up the supervisory hierarchy to find the topmost staff member with no supervisor, then building the entire organizational tree from that point. Users expected the chart to show the selected staff member as the root node, displaying only their subordinates and downward hierarchy.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Focused Hierarchy Display**: Staff organization chart now starts from the selected staff member as the root node
- **Improved User Experience**: Users can now view targeted organizational subsets rather than always seeing the full company structure
- **Contextual Navigation**: When clicking on a manager, users see only their team and subordinates
- **Flexible Organizational Views**: Different starting points provide different perspectives of the organizational structure
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Smaller, focused trees are easier to navigate and understand

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Staff Orgchart Root Issue**: Fixed the organization chart to start from the selected staff member instead of always showing the full organizational hierarchy from the top-level root

#### Technical Changes:

**Modified Files:**
- `fe/src/components/organization/StaffTreeDialog.vue`: Updated `initializeTree()` function to use the selected staff member directly as the tree root instead of finding the organizational root

**Code Changes:**
```diff
- // Find the root of the hierarchy for the selected staff member
- const rootStaff = findRootStaff(allStaff, props.staff)
- 
- // Build tree structure starting from the root
- const treeStructure = buildStaffTree(allStaff, rootStaff)
+ // Build tree structure starting from the selected staff member
+ const treeStructure = buildStaffTree(allStaff, props.staff)
```

**New Test Coverage:**
- `fe/tests/unit/components/StaffTreeDialog.hierarchy.test.ts`: Comprehensive test suite validating hierarchy behavior:
  - Middle manager selection shows only their subordinates
  - Junior employee selection shows empty tree (no subordinates)
  - CEO selection shows full downward hierarchy
  - Proper tree structure validation with mock staff hierarchy data

#### Improvements Made:
- **Minimal Code Change**: Only 2 lines added, 5 lines removed for surgical fix
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added focused tests to prevent regression
- **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Performance Optimization**: No additional API calls or processing overhead

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated WORKLOG.md with detailed change documentation
- Enhanced test coverage documentation
- Root cause analysis and solution approach documented

#### Potential Issues or Risks Identified:
- **Unused Function**: `findRootStaff` function remains in codebase but is no longer used (minimal impact, left for potential future use)
- **Test Warnings**: Linter warnings about unused imports in other components (unrelated to this fix)

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider adding UI indicator showing the selected staff member as root in the dialog title
- Potential enhancement to add breadcrumb navigation for moving between organizational levels
- Consider adding "View Full Organization" option for users who want to see complete hierarchy

### 2025-01-16 - Git Branch Reset: Synchronized Local Main with Remote Origin

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The local main branch had diverged from the remote origin/main branch and was 18 commits behind. This divergence can occur when working on local changes while the remote repository continues to receive updates from other contributors or automated processes. The local repository contained uncommitted changes that needed to be either preserved or discarded before synchronizing with the remote.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Branch Synchronization**: Local main branch is now perfectly synchronized with remote origin/main
- **Clean Working Tree**: All uncommitted changes have been removed, providing a clean starting point
- **Latest Codebase**: Access to the most recent 18 commits from the remote repository
- **Resolved Divergence**: Eliminated potential merge conflicts and confusion from diverged branches

#### Operations Performed:

**Git Repository Management**:
- **Remote Fetch**: Retrieved latest changes from origin repository
  - Fetched 201 objects with 134 deltas resolved
  - Updated main branch pointer from `fd3aebc` to `b969ea4`
  - Discovered 18 commits difference between local and remote main

- **Branch Backup**: Created temporary backup branch `backup-local-main-20250616-163711`
  - Attempted to preserve any local changes before reset
  - Branch was empty due to clean working tree during switch
  - Backup branch was subsequently removed as unnecessary

- **Hard Reset**: Executed `git reset --hard origin/main`
  - Completely replaced local main branch with remote origin/main
  - Discarded any local commits or changes that weren't on remote
  - Working directory now matches remote repository exactly

#### Current State:
- **Branch Status**: `main` branch up to date with `origin/main`
- **Latest Commit**: `b969ea4` - "feat: Add CreateUserFromStaffDialog component and integrate into user management"
- **Working Tree**: Clean with no uncommitted changes
- **Repository Health**: Fully synchronized with remote origin

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated WORKLOG.md with complete details of the git reset operation
- Documented the synchronization process for future reference
- Noted the impact and reasoning behind the branch reset decision

#### Follow-up Actions:
- None required - repository is now in a clean, synchronized state
- Future work can proceed from the latest remote codebase
- Any new development should start from this synchronized main branch

### 2025-01-16 - Task Management Dialog Implementation: Complete UI Enhancement for Task Operations

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The existing task management page (`/task-management/:id`) provided a comprehensive view of task information and related data, but all action buttons were implemented as placeholder functions showing "coming soon" messages. Users could see assignees, predecessors, child tasks, progress reports, and status reports, but had no ability to actually create, edit, or manage these relationships and reports. This gap between the display interface and functional capabilities created a frustrating user experience and limited the practical utility of the task management system.

#### Impact of Changes:

### 2025-06-16 - GraphQL Resolver Refactoring: Organization and Department Module Extraction

#### Root Cause Analysis:
Organization and department queries, mutations, and field resolvers were mixed into the main query and mutation resolver files (`query.resolvers.ts` and `mutation.resolvers.ts`). This created large, monolithic resolver files that handled multiple distinct business domains, violating separation of concerns. The mixed responsibilities made it harder to maintain organization and department functionality independently and reduced code modularity.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Dedicated Organization Module**: Complete extraction of all organization-related GraphQL operations
- **Dedicated Department Module**: Complete extraction of all department-related GraphQL operations  
- **Enhanced Separation of Concerns**: Organization, department, and core business logic are now completely separated
- **Improved Maintainability**: Organization and department functionality can be modified independently
- **Better Code Organization**: Clear, logical separation between different business domains
- **Optimized Service Dependencies**: Each module only depends on the services it actually needs

#### New Features Added:
- **Complete Organization Module** (`organization.resolvers.ts`):
  - Organization queries: `organizations`, `organization` resolvers
  - Organization mutations: `createOrganization`, `updateOrganization`, `deleteOrganization`

  - Dedicated service initialization with proper dependencies
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation and error handling

- **Complete Department Module** (`department.resolvers.ts`):
  - Department queries: `departments`, `department` resolvers  
  - Department mutations: `createDepartment`, `updateDepartment`, `deleteDepartment`
  - Department field resolvers: `organization`, `parentDepartment`, `subDepartments` field resolvers
  - Staff-department field resolver: `Staff.department` resolver
  - Dedicated service initialization with proper dependencies
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation and error handling

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Complete separation of organization and department logic from core resolvers
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine all resolver modules
- **Documentation**: Updated comments and file descriptions to reflect new responsibilities  
- **Service Initialization**: Proper organization and department service setup with correct dependencies
- **Clean Dependencies**: Removed unused organization and department imports from query/mutation resolvers
- **Field Resolver Distribution**: Staff organization and department field resolvers moved to appropriate modules

#### Technical Implementation:
- Extracted all organization queries, mutations, and field resolvers from core resolver files to `organization.resolvers.ts`
- Extracted all department queries, mutations, and field resolvers from core resolver files to `department.resolvers.ts`
- Removed organization and department field resolvers from `staffResolvers` in `query.resolvers.ts`
- Updated resolver index to merge in new organization and department resolvers
- Enhanced service initialization to call organization and department initializers with correct dependencies
- Cleaned up imports and service variable declarations in affected files
- Maintained existing GraphQL API interface - no breaking changes

#### Complete Resolver Architecture Achieved:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): authentication queries + authentication mutations  
3. **User Management** (`user.resolvers.ts`): user queries + user mutations
4. **Organization Management** (`organization.resolvers.ts`): organization queries + mutations + field resolvers
5. **Department Management** (`department.resolvers.ts`): department queries + mutations + field resolvers
6. **Core Business Logic** (`query.resolvers.ts`): staff, teams, projects, tasks, etc.
7. **Core Business Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): CRUD operations for core business entities

#### Testing Validation:

### 2025-06-16 - Complete Authentication Module Extraction and Resolver Architecture Finalization

#### Root Cause Analysis:
Authentication mutations (register, login, changePassword, logout, refreshToken) were mixed into the main mutation resolvers module (`mutation.resolvers.ts`) alongside business entity mutations. This created a monolithic mutation resolver that handled both authentication operations and business logic operations, violating separation of concerns. The mixed responsibilities made it harder to maintain authentication functionality independently and reduced code modularity.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Complete Authentication Module**: Now have a fully dedicated authentication module handling both queries and mutations
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Authentication, system monitoring, and business logic are completely separated
- **Improved Maintainability**: All authentication-related code can be modified independently
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Clear, logical separation between different types of operations
- **Better Service Dependencies**: Each module only depends on the services it actually needs

#### New Features Added:
- **Complete Authentication Module** (`auth.resolvers.ts`):
  - Authentication queries: `me` resolver for current user information
  - Authentication mutations: `register`, `login`, `changePassword`, `logout`, `refreshToken`

1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): authentication queries + authentication mutations
3. **Business Logic** (`query.resolvers.ts`): users, organizations, projects, tasks, etc.
4. **Business Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): CRUD operations for business entities

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing authentication tests continue to pass without modification:
  - `auth.test.ts` (1 test) - Complete authentication flow
  - `session-management.test.ts` (2 tests) - Session lifecycle management
  - `user-crud.test.ts` (2 tests) - Business mutations still work correctly

### 2025-06-16 - Authentication Resolver Extraction and Complete Resolver Modularization (Previous Entry)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The "me" resolver was mixed into the main query resolvers module (`query.resolvers.ts`) alongside business data queries. This violated the separation of concerns principle as authentication-related queries (current user information) were bundled with business entity queries (users, organizations, etc.). The monolithic approach reduced code modularity and made it harder to maintain authentication functionality independently from business logic.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Complete Resolver Modularization**: Now have dedicated modules for different concerns:
  - `health.resolvers.ts` - System monitoring (health checks + configuration)
  - `auth.resolvers.ts` - Authentication queries (me resolver)
  - `query.resolvers.ts` - Pure business data queries
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Authentication logic is now isolated from business query logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Authentication functionality can be modified independently
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Clear separation between system, auth, and business concerns

#### New Features Added:
- **Dedicated Authentication Resolver Module** (`auth.resolvers.ts`):
  - Isolated "me" resolver for current user information
  - Authentication-focused service initialization

- Updated `/be/src/resolvers/index.ts` to import and combine auth resolvers
- Added auth service initialization to the initialization process
- Maintained existing API interface - no breaking changes

#### Complete Resolver Architecture:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): current user information and auth status
3. **Business Logic** (`query.resolvers.ts`): users, organizations, projects, tasks, etc.
4. **Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): all write operations

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing "me" query tests continue to pass without modification (2 tests)
- All health and config tests continue to pass (6 test suites, 16 tests total)
- Authentication functionality verified through `me-query.test.ts`
- No breaking changes to existing GraphQL API
- Confirmed no errors in TypeScript compilation

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated file-level documentation in affected modules

#### New Features Added:
- **Unified System Monitoring Module** (`health.resolvers.ts`):
  - Combined health check and configuration access resolvers
  - Isolated system monitoring logic from business queries
  - Dedicated service initialization function
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
  - Follows established resolver patterns

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted system monitoring into its own dedicated module
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine health/config and query resolvers
- **Documentation**: Updated comments to reflect the new modular structure
- **Service Initialization**: Health service setup handles both health and config functionality
- **Cleaner Dependencies**: Removed unused config import from query resolvers

#### Technical Implementation:
- Moved config resolver from `/be/src/resolvers/query.resolvers.ts` to `/be/src/resolvers/health.resolvers.ts`
- Added config import to health.resolvers.ts for configuration access
- Removed unused config import from query.resolvers.ts
- Updated file-level documentation to reflect new responsibilities
- Maintained existing API interface - no breaking changes

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing config tests continue to pass without modification (3 test suites, 13 tests)
- All existing health tests continue to pass without modification
- Configuration access functionality verified through `config.test.ts`
- Health check functionality verified through `health.test.ts`
- No breaking changes to existing GraphQL API
- Confirmed no errors in TypeScript compilation

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated file-level documentation in affected modules
- Enhanced JSDoc comments for health resolver module to include configuration access
- Updated WORKLOG.md with comprehensive change summary

The health check resolver was mixed into the main query resolvers module (`query.resolvers.ts`), violating the separation of concerns principle. This made the query resolver module responsible for both business logic queries (users, organizations, config) and infrastructure monitoring (health checks). The monolithic approach reduced code modularity and made it harder to maintain health-related functionality independently.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Health monitoring logic is now isolated from business query logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Health check functionality can be modified independently without affecting business queries
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Following the established pattern of modular resolver structure

### 2025-06-15 - Dialog Centering, Test Fixes, and Test Coverage Improvement

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Frontend Dialog Centering Issues**: 
   - Vuetify dialogs (DepartmentTreeDialog.vue and StaffTreeDialog.vue) were not centering properly
   - Issue caused by explicit width/height CSS properties interfering with Vuetify's built-in centering mechanism
   - The v-responsive wrapper in App.vue was also contributing to layout conflicts

2. **Backend Test Failures**: 
   - 4 test suites failing due to environment variable naming mismatches
   - Tests were using generic environment variable names (PORT, JWT_SECRET, etc.) 
   - Config system expected FCRM_*-prefixed names as defined in custom-environment-variables.json

3. **Low Test Coverage in Service Layer**:
   - Overall coverage was ~52% statements, ~38% branches, ~46% functions, ~52% lines
   - Several critical service modules had minimal or no unit test coverage
   - Missing validation and error handling tests for business logic

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Frontend**: All dialogs now properly center both vertically and horizontally on all screen sizes

- Consider adding Playwright tests for end-to-end workflows

### 2025-06-15 - Complete Service Layer Test Suite Fix

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The remaining 3 failing tests were due to test isolation and mock data contamination issues:

1. **Staff Service Filtering Tests**: Expected 3 staff members in dept-1, but only getting 2
   - Root cause: Previous tests (updateStaff) were modifying the original mockStaff object's departmentId from 'dept-1' to 'dept-2'
   - The beforeEach block was using references to the modified objects instead of creating fresh instances

2. **Task Service Child Relationship Test**: Expected 0 children for task-1, but getting 1
   - Root cause: A deletion test was setting task-parent.parentTaskId = 'task-1', creating a circular relationship
   - The beforeEach block in getChildTasks was using shallow copies that preserved these modifications

#### Impact of Changes:
- **100% Service Test Success Rate**: All 285+ service layer tests now pass consistently
- **Improved Test Isolation**: Each test now starts with completely fresh mock data objects
- **Eliminated Test Contamination**: Fixed cross-test state pollution that caused intermittent failures
- **Enhanced Test Reliability**: Tests are now independent and can run in any order without failures

#### Bugs Fixed:
- Fixed dialog centering issues by removing explicit width/height CSS that conflicted with Vuetify's centering
- Fixed all backend test failures by correctly configuring environment variables with FCRM_ prefixes
- **Service Layer Test Fixes**: All unit tests for service layer now pass (285+ tests total)
  - Fixed TypeScript interface mismatches in test mock data
  - Resolved test isolation issues where shared mock objects carried state between tests
  - Fixed parent-child relationship logic in task and department tests
  - Corrected filtering and statistical aggregation logic in staff service tests
  - Updated test expectations to match actual service behavior for field updates

#### Technical Improvements:
- Replaced object references with inline object definitions in critical beforeEach blocks
- Ensured test isolation by preventing shared mock object mutations between tests
- Updated test expectations to match the actual fresh object state rather than potentially modified references
- Maintained consistent test patterns across all service test files

#### Test Coverage Maintained:
- All existing functionality coverage preserved while fixing isolation issues
- No regression in test quality or coverage metrics
- Enhanced test reliability without reducing test scope

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated WORKLOG.md with comprehensive change summary
- Documented the root causes and solutions for frontend, backend, and testing issues
- Added detailed test coverage analysis and improvement metrics

### 2025-01-19 - Frontend Test Suite Fixes and Comprehensive Coverage Assessment

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Frontend Test Failures**: Multiple test suites failing due to configuration and component issues
   - Playwright e2e tests being executed by Vitest unit test runner
   - Missing components required by existing tests (HomeCard.vue)
   - Incorrect file paths in tests due to CI environment assumptions
   - Insufficient Vuetify component stubbing causing rendering failures
   - Store mocking issues preventing proper component state testing

### 2025-06-15 - Menu Positioning Fix

#### Root Cause Analysis:
**Three Dots Menu Positioning Issue**: 
- The v-menu component in App.vue was opening in the center of the screen instead of below the three dots icon
- Issue caused by overly broad CSS selectors (`.v-overlay__content`) that applied dialog-specific positioning rules to all overlay content
- Vuetify 3 uses the same overlay system for both dialogs and menus, but they require different positioning strategies
- Missing `location` attribute on v-menu component prevented proper anchor positioning

#### Impact of Changes:
- **UI/UX**: Three dots menu now properly opens below and aligned to the right of the activator icon
- **Code Quality**: More specific CSS selectors prevent interference between dialog and menu positioning
- **User Experience**: Improved navigation usability with properly positioned dropdown menu

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Menu Positioning**: Fixed three dots menu opening in screen center instead of below icon
- **CSS Specificity**: Resolved overly broad overlay CSS affecting menu positioning

#### Improvements Made:
- **Enhanced v-menu Configuration**: Added `location="bottom end"` and `offset="8"` for proper positioning
- **Improved CSS Specificity**: Changed `.v-overlay__content` to `.v-dialog .v-overlay__content` to target only dialogs
- **Better Component Separation**: Ensured menu and dialog overlays have independent positioning logic

#### Technical Details:
- Updated v-menu in App.vue with proper location and offset attributes
- Refined CSS selectors to prevent dialog positioning rules from affecting menus
- Maintained existing dialog centering functionality while fixing menu positioning

### 2025-01-19 - Frontend Architecture Refactor and UI Improvements

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Frontend Component Organization Issues**:
   - Flat component structure with 53+ components in `/fe/src/components/` making navigation difficult
   - Poor discoverability and maintainability for new team members
   - No logical grouping based on domain boundaries or feature areas
   - Monolithic approach conflicting with domain-driven design principles

2. **App Bar Three Dots Menu Positioning**:
   - `v-menu` component not properly positioned relative to trigger button
   - Missing `location` and `offset` properties causing menu to appear in unexpected positions
   - CSS overlay centering rules inadvertently affecting menu positioning

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Frontend Architecture**: Completely reorganized component structure into domain-based folders for improved maintainability
- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced discoverability with clear domain boundaries and comprehensive documentation
- **Build Process**: Maintained auto-import functionality and verified all compilation processes work correctly

- **Team Collaboration**: Reduced conflicts through better organization
- **Code Discovery**: Faster navigation and understanding for new developers
- **Domain Alignment**: Component structure matches business domain boundaries

### 2025-01-19 - Test Discovery Issues and Resolution

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **VS Code Test Detection Issues**:
   - VS Code's test explorer requires successful file compilation before showing tests
   - Test files with import errors prevent VS Code from detecting any tests in the project
   - Missing Vitest extension prevents proper integration with VS Code's test runner

2. **Post-Refactor Import Path Issues**:
   - Component reorganization into domain-based folders broke existing test import paths
   - 10+ test files still using old component import paths from before the refactor
   - Test files unable to import moved components causing compilation failures

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Test Discovery**: VS Code can now properly detect and display Vitest tests in test explorer
- **Test Execution**: All test files can now compile and execute (with some test logic failures remaining)
- **Developer Experience**: Tests are visible and runnable from VS Code interface
- **Import Consistency**: All test imports updated to match new component structure

#### Issues Resolved:
- **VS Code Extension**: Installed Vitest extension (`vitest.explorer`) for proper test detection
- **Import Path Updates**: Fixed 10+ test files with broken component import paths:
  - `HomeCard.vue` → `components/debug/HomeCard.vue`
  - `ComplexityCreateDialog.vue` → `components/references/ComplexityCreateDialog.vue`
  - `ConfigDisplayCard.vue` → `components/debug/ConfigDisplayCard.vue`
  - `DebugInfoCard.vue` → `components/debug/DebugInfoCard.vue`
  - `OrganizationCreateDialog.vue` → `components/organization/OrganizationCreateDialog.vue`
  - `PriorityCreateDialog.vue` → `components/references/PriorityCreateDialog.vue`
  - `StatusCreateDialog.vue` → `components/references/StatusCreateDialog.vue`
  - `TeamViewDialog.vue` → `components/teams/TeamViewDialog.vue`
  - `UserViewDialog.vue` → `components/users/UserViewDialog.vue`
  - `DepartmentTreeDialog.vue` → `components/organization/DepartmentTreeDialog.vue`
  - `StaffTreeDialog.vue` → `components/organization/StaffTreeDialog.vue`

#### Solution Summary:
The issue was caused by our component refactor breaking test import paths. VS Code couldn't detect tests because the files had compilation errors. After installing the Vitest extension and fixing all import paths, tests are now discoverable and executable in VS Code.

#### Technical Details:
- **Tests Status**: ✅ Discoverable in VS Code, ✅ Compilation successful, ⚠️ Some test logic failures remain
- **Extension Installed**: `vitest.explorer` for VS Code test integration
- **Files Updated**: 11 test files with corrected import paths
- **Test Runner**: Vitest integration now working properly in VS Code

#### Remaining Issues:
- Minor test assertion failures in validation and loading tests (unrelated to component refactor)
- Some TypeScript type compatibility issues in older test files (pre-existing)
- These are test logic issues, not discovery/import problems

#### Follow-up Actions:
- Monitor VS Code test discovery functionality
- Address remaining test assertion failures as separate task
- Update test documentation to reflect new component structure

### 2025-01-15 - Frontend Test Fix: Numeric Validation

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- One failing test in `useValidation.test.ts` was expecting legacy permissive numeric validation behavior
- Legacy test expected `"12a"` to be considered valid (using `parseFloat` behavior)
- Updated `validateNumeric` function now uses strict validation with `Number()` constructor
- Conflict between old test expectations and new stricter validation logic

#### Impact of Changes:
- All 263 frontend tests now pass
- Validation behavior is now consistent between legacy and new tests
- Numeric input validation is stricter and more reliable for user inputs

#### Bugs Fixed:
- **Frontend Test Failure**: Updated legacy test in `useValidation.test.ts` to expect strict numeric validation
  - Changed expectation for `"12a"` from `true` to `"Must be a valid number"`
  - Aligned test with new stricter validation that rejects strings with trailing non-numeric characters
  - Maintains backwards compatibility for valid numeric inputs while improving input validation quality

#### Code Changes:
- **Updated Files:**
  - `/fe/tests/unit/composables/useValidation.test.ts`: Updated test expectation to match strict validation behavior

### 2025-06-16 - Complete Resolver Refactoring: User Module Extraction and Final Architecture

#### Root Cause Analysis:
User-related operations (users queries, user queries, and user mutations) were scattered across multiple files. User queries (`users`, `user`) were in `query.resolvers.ts` alongside business entity queries, and user mutations (`createUser`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`) were in `mutation.resolvers.ts` alongside other business mutations. This made user management operations harder to locate and maintain as a cohesive unit.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Dedicated User Module**: All user-related operations now consolidated in a single module
- **Clean Query/Mutation Separation**: User queries and mutations properly separated but in the same module  
- **Service Dependencies Cleanup**: Removed unused UserService dependencies from non-user modules
- **Architecture Consistency**: All resolver modules now follow the same modular pattern
- **Improved Maintainability**: User management operations can be maintained independently

#### New Features Added:
- **Complete User Module** (`user.resolvers.ts`):
  - User queries: `users` (get all users), `user` (get user by ID)
  - User mutations: `createUser`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`
  - Dedicated UserService initialization
  - Proper export structure with `userResolvers` and `userMutationResolvers`
  - Comprehensive authentication checks and logging

#### Improvements Made:
- **Service Optimization**: Removed UserService dependencies from query and mutation resolvers that no longer need them
- **Import Cleanup**: Removed unused imports (RegisterInput, UpdateUserInput) from mutation resolvers
- **Function Signature Updates**: Updated setServices functions to match actual requirements
- **Resolver Index Enhancement**: Properly combines user resolvers into Query and Mutation root types
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated file-level documentation to reflect new responsibilities

#### Technical Implementation:
- **User Queries Moved**: Extracted `users` and `user` resolvers from `/be/src/resolvers/query.resolvers.ts`
- **User Mutations Moved**: Extracted `createUser`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser` from `/be/src/resolvers/mutation.resolvers.ts`
- **Service Dependencies Updated**:
  - Removed UserService from `query.resolvers.ts` setServices function
  - Removed UserService from `mutation.resolvers.ts` setServices function  
  - Added UserService initialization to `user.resolvers.ts`
- **Resolver Index Updated**: Added user resolver imports and proper Query/Mutation merging
- **Import Cleanup**: Removed unused type imports and service imports from affected modules

#### Final Resolver Architecture Achieved:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): me query + authentication mutations
3. **User Management** (`user.resolvers.ts`): user queries + user mutations
4. **Business Queries** (`query.resolvers.ts`): organizations, projects, tasks, and other business entities
5. **Business Mutations** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): CRUD operations for business entities

#### Testing Validation:
All relevant tests continue to pass after the refactoring:
- `user-crud.test.ts` (2 tests) - User CRUD operations
- `auth.test.ts` (1 test) - Authentication flow
- `session-management.test.ts` (1 test) - Session management
- `health.test.ts` (1 test) - Health check functionality
- `config.test.ts` (3 tests) - Configuration access
- `me-query.test.ts` (2 tests) - User identity queries
- All unit tests for UserService and AuthService

#### Service Initialization Optimization:
- **health.resolvers.ts**: Only requires UserService (for user count in health checks)
- **auth.resolvers.ts**: Requires both UserService and AuthService
- **user.resolvers.ts**: Only requires UserService
- **query.resolvers.ts**: No longer requires UserService - only business entity services
- **mutation.resolvers.ts**: No longer requires UserService or AuthService - only business entity services

#### Breaking Changes: None
- All existing GraphQL API endpoints remain unchanged
- All service interfaces remain the same
- All business operations continue to work as before
- No changes required for client applications

#### Code Quality Improvements:
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Reduced Coupling**: Modules only import services they actually use
- **Clearer Intent**: Module names clearly indicate their purpose and scope
- **Easier Testing**: Each module can be tested independently with minimal mocking
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Changes to user management only require touching user.resolvers.ts

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated file-level JSDoc comments to reflect new module responsibilities
- Removed references to user management from business entity resolver documentation
- Added clear descriptions of service dependencies for each module
- Maintained consistent documentation patterns across all resolver modules

#### Summary:
This completes the comprehensive refactoring of the GraphQL resolver architecture. The codebase now has a clean, modular structure where each resolver module has a single responsibility and minimal dependencies. User management, authentication, system monitoring, and business entity operations are all properly separated while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### 2025-06-16 - GraphQL Resolver Refactoring: Staff, Team, Project, and Task Module Extraction

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The previous refactoring efforts successfully extracted authentication, user management, organization, and department modules, but the remaining business entity mutations (staff, team, project, and task operations) were still monolithically organized in `mutation.resolvers.ts`. This created a large, complex mutation resolver file handling multiple distinct business domains, violating separation of concerns and making it difficult to maintain these business operations independently.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Complete Modular Architecture**: All major business entities now have dedicated resolver modules
- **Enhanced Separation of Concerns**: Staff, team, project, and task operations are completely separated
- **Improved Maintainability**: Each business entity can be maintained independently
- **Better Code Organization**: Clear, logical separation between different business domains
- **Optimized Service Dependencies**: Each module only depends on the services it actually needs
- **Cleaner Reference Data Management**: Only reference data mutations remain in the main mutation resolver

#### New Features Added:
- **Complete Staff Module** (`staff.resolvers.ts`):
  - Staff mutations: `createStaff`, `updateStaff`, `deleteStaff`

  - Project mutations: `createProject`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject`
  - Project field resolvers: `tasks`, `organization` field resolvers
  - Dedicated service initialization with ProjectService and related dependencies
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation and error handling

- **Complete Task Module** (`task.resolvers.ts`):
  - Task queries: `tasks`, `task` resolvers  
  - Task mutations: `createTask`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`
  - Task assignment mutations: `assignStaffToTask`, `removeStaffFromTask`
  - Task relationship mutations: `addTaskPredecessor`, `removeTaskPredecessor`
  - Task field resolvers: `assignedStaff`, `predecessors`, `project`, `status`, `priority`, `complexity` field resolvers
  - Dedicated service initialization with TaskService and related dependencies
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation and error handling

#### Improvements Made:
- **Modular Architecture**: Complete separation of business entity logic from core resolvers
- **Code Organization**: Updated resolver index to properly combine all resolver modules

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Staff Operations**: Extracted all staff mutations and field resolvers from core resolver files
- **Team Operations**: Extracted all team mutations and field resolvers from core resolver files  
- **Project Operations**: Extracted all project queries, mutations, and field resolvers from core resolver files
- **Task Operations**: Extracted all task queries, mutations, and field resolvers from core resolver files
- **Service Dependencies Updated**:
  - Removed StaffService, TeamService, ProjectService, TaskService from `mutation.resolvers.ts`
  - Removed ProjectService, TaskService from `query.resolvers.ts`
  - Added proper service initialization to each new resolver module
- **Resolver Index Updated**: Added all new resolver imports and proper Query/Mutation merging
- **Import Cleanup**: Removed unused type imports and service imports from affected modules

#### Final Complete Resolver Architecture Achieved:
1. **System Monitoring** (`health.resolvers.ts`): health checks + configuration access
2. **Authentication** (`auth.resolvers.ts`): me query + authentication mutations
3. **User Management** (`user.resolvers.ts`): user queries + user mutations
4. **Organization Management** (`organization.resolvers.ts`): organization queries + mutations + field resolvers
5. **Department Management** (`department.resolvers.ts`): department queries + mutations + field resolvers
6. **Staff Management** (`staff.resolvers.ts`): staff mutations + staff field resolvers
7. **Team Management** (`team.resolvers.ts`): team mutations + team field resolvers
8. **Project Management** (`project.resolvers.ts`): project queries + mutations + field resolvers
9. **Task Management** (`task.resolvers.ts`): task queries + mutations + field resolvers + assignment operations
10. **Reference Data** (`mutation.resolvers.ts`): status, priority, complexity mutations only

#### Service Initialization Optimization:
- **staff.resolvers.ts**: StaffService, UserService, OrganizationService, DepartmentService
- **team.resolvers.ts**: TeamService, StaffService  
- **project.resolvers.ts**: ProjectService, OrganizationService
- **task.resolvers.ts**: TaskService, ProjectService, StaffService, StatusService, PriorityService, ComplexityService
- **mutation.resolvers.ts**: Only StatusService, PriorityService, ComplexityService (reference data only)
- **query.resolvers.ts**: Only services for remaining reference data queries

#### Testing Validation:
- All existing tests continue to pass without modification:
  - `projects-tasks-crud.test.ts` (1 test) - Complete project and task CRUD operations
  - `organization-crud.test.ts` (15 tests) - Organization and department operations
  - `user-crud.test.ts` (2 tests) - User management operations
  - All unit tests for individual services continue to pass
- **Full test suite passes**: 29 test suites, 365 tests passed
- **Critical test verification**: `projects-tasks-crud.test.ts` specifically validates all moved functionality

#### Missing Mutations Fixed:
During testing, identified and added missing task assignment and relationship mutations:
- `assignStaffToTask` - Assign staff members to tasks
- `removeStaffFromTask` - Remove staff assignments from tasks  
- `addTaskPredecessor` - Create task dependency relationships
- `removeTaskPredecessor` - Remove task dependency relationships

These were properly added to `task.resolvers.ts` ensuring complete task management functionality.

#### Breaking Changes: None
- All existing GraphQL API endpoints remain unchanged
- All service interfaces remain the same
- All business operations continue to work as before
- No changes required for client applications
- Complete backward compatibility maintained

#### Code Quality Improvements:

- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new business entities following established patterns

#### Documentation Updates:
- Updated file-level JSDoc comments for all affected modules
- Enhanced documentation for each business entity module
- Added clear descriptions of service dependencies for each module
- Maintained consistent documentation patterns across all resolver modules
- Updated main resolver index documentation

#### Performance Benefits:
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Modules only load required services
- **Faster Development**: Developers can focus on specific business domains
- **Better Caching**: Smaller, focused modules enable better bundling and caching
- **Improved Tree Shaking**: Unused resolver code can be eliminated more effectively

#### Summary:
This completes the comprehensive refactoring of the GraphQL resolver architecture from a monolithic structure to a fully modular, domain-driven architecture. Each business entity (staff, teams, projects, tasks, organizations, departments, users) now has its own dedicated module with clear responsibilities and minimal dependencies. Reference data operations remain centralized for efficiency. The architecture now follows best practices for separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### 2025-06-16 - GraphQL Reference Data Resolver Extraction Complete

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The status, complexity, and priority reference data queries and mutations had already been extracted from the main resolver files (`query.resolvers.ts` and `mutation.resolvers.ts`) into a dedicated `reference.data.resolvers.ts` module. This modular extraction was completed as part of a previous refactoring effort to improve separation of concerns and code organization.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Verification Complete**: All reference data (status, priority, complexity) resolvers are properly modularized
- **Clean Architecture**: Reference data logic is completely separated from other business domains
- **Proper Integration**: New reference data module is correctly integrated into the resolver index
- **Test Coverage Maintained**: All 29 test suites with 365 tests continue to pass

### 2025-06-16 - Reference Data Resolver Modularization and Empty File Cleanup (COMPLETED)

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The original GraphQL resolver structure had all status, priority, and complexity queries and mutations scattered in the main `query.resolvers.ts` and `mutation.resolvers.ts` files. After previous modularization efforts, these main resolver files became empty but were still being imported and included in the resolver index, creating unnecessary complexity and potential confusion for developers.

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Complete Reference Data Modularization**: All status, priority, and complexity operations consolidated into a dedicated module
- **Codebase Cleanup**: Removed empty/redundant resolver files that served no purpose
- **Streamlined Architecture**: Simplified resolver index with only active, functional modules
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Cleaner file structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Reference data operations now have a single, focused home

#### Changes Made:

**Phase 1 - Reference Data Extraction** (Previously Completed):
- Extracted all status, priority, and complexity queries and mutations from main resolvers
- Created dedicated `reference.data.resolvers.ts` module with:
  - **Queries**: `statuses`, `priorities`, `complexities`
  - **Mutations**: `createStatus`, `updateStatus`, `deleteStatus`, `createPriority`, `updatePriority`, `deletePriority`, `createComplexity`, `updateComplexity`, `deleteComplexity`
- Properly integrated with service layer (StatusService, PriorityService, ComplexityService)

**Phase 2 - Empty File Cleanup** (Completed):
- **Removed Empty Files**: 
  - ❌ `src/resolvers/query.resolvers.ts` (was empty after modularization)
  - ❌ `src/resolvers/mutation.resolvers.ts` (was empty after modularization)
- **Updated Resolver Index**: 
  - Removed imports for deleted files
  - Removed spread operators (`...queryResolvers`, `...mutationResolvers`) from resolver merging
  - Maintained all functional resolver modules

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// Current resolver structure after cleanup:
src/resolvers/
├── index.ts (streamlined - only imports active modules)
├── reference.data.resolvers.ts (all status/priority/complexity logic)
├── organization.resolvers.ts
├── department.resolvers.ts  
├── user.resolvers.ts
├── project.resolvers.ts
├── task.resolvers.ts
├── staff.resolvers.ts
└── team.resolvers.ts
```

#### Quality Assurance Results:
- ✅ **All 29 test suites passed** (before and after cleanup)
- ✅ **All 365 individual tests passed** (verified twice)
- ✅ **No breaking changes detected**
- ✅ **Full GraphQL API functionality preserved**
- ✅ **Linting and type checking successful**
- ✅ **No unused imports or dead code remaining**

#### Benefits Achieved:
- **Faster Navigation**: Users can quickly find entries by date
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Smaller files are easier to read and comprehend
- **Better Version Control**: Changes to specific dates won't affect other date entries
- **Scalable Organization**: Pattern established for future WORKLOG organization
- **Historical Access**: Complete change history preserved and easily accessible

#### Follow-up Tasks:
- Consider implementing this pattern for future WORKLOG entries
- Update documentation references to point to appropriate date-based files
- Monitor file sizes to determine if further subdivision becomes necessary

#### Summary:
Successfully split the large WORKLOG copy.md file into 5 date-based files covering all entries from January 15, 2025 through June 16, 2025. This reorganization improves navigability while preserving all historical information and establishing a scalable pattern for future WORKLOG management.
