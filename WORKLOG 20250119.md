### 2025-01-19 - Frontend Test Suite Fixes and Comprehensive Coverage Assessment

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Frontend Test Failures**: Multiple test suites failing due to configuration and component issues
   - Playwright e2e tests being executed by Vitest unit test runner
   - Missing components required by existing tests (HomeCard.vue)
   - Incorrect file paths in tests due to CI environment assumptions
   - Insufficient Vuetify component stubbing causing rendering failures
   - Store mocking issues preventing proper component state testing

2. **Test Infrastructure Issues**:
   - Vitest configuration excluded e2e tests but included them in test runs
   - Component stubs were too simple (boolean `true`) preventing text content validation
   - Missing sophisticated component mocking for Vuetify UI components

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Frontend Test Success**: All 119 frontend tests now pass across 21 test files
- **Test Reliability**: Fixed inconsistent test behavior and environment dependencies

### 2025-01-19 - Frontend Architecture Refactor and UI Improvements

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Frontend Component Organization Issues**:
   - Flat component structure with 53+ components in `/fe/src/components/` making navigation difficult
   - Poor discoverability and maintainability for new team members
   - No logical grouping based on domain boundaries or feature areas
   - Monolithic approach conflicting with domain-driven design principles

2. **App Bar Three Dots Menu Positioning**:
   - `v-menu` component not properly positioned relative to trigger button
   - Missing `location` and `offset` properties causing menu to appear in unexpected positions
   - CSS overlay centering rules inadvertently affecting menu positioning

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Frontend Architecture**: Completely reorganized component structure into domain-based folders for improved maintainability
- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced discoverability with clear domain boundaries and comprehensive documentation
- **Build Process**: Maintained auto-import functionality and verified all compilation processes work correctly
- **UI/UX**: Fixed three dots menu positioning for better user experience

#### New Features Added:
- **Domain-Based Component Architecture:**
  - `common/` - Shared UI components (AppBar, AppFooter, ConfirmDialog, etc.)
  - `auth/` - Authentication-related components (LoginForm, etc.)
  - `organization/` - Organization management components (dialogs, forms)
  - `teams/` - Team management components (dialogs, lists)
  - `projects/` - Project and task management components
  - `references/` - Reference data management components
  - `users/` - User management components
  - `debug/` - Development and debugging utilities

- **Comprehensive Documentation System:**
  - Main `/fe/src/components/README.md` with architecture overview
  - Individual README.md files for each domain folder explaining purpose and components
  - Clear guidelines for component placement and organization

#### Bugs Fixed:
- Three dots menu positioning in app bar (added `location="bottom end"` and `offset="8"`)
- CSS overlay centering affecting menus (updated to target only dialogs)
- Import path issues after component reorganization (updated all relative imports)
- Type error in `UserCreateDialog.vue` form data initialization
- Auto-import functionality maintained across all moved components

#### Improvements Made:
- **Code Organization**: Migrated from flat to domain-based folder structure
- **Import Management**: Removed manual component imports in favor of auto-imports
- **Path Resolution**: Updated all relative import paths to match new folder depth
- **Type Safety**: Fixed type errors and ensured TypeScript compilation success
- **Build Verification**: Confirmed all build processes work correctly after refactor

### 2025-01-19 - Test Discovery Issues and Resolution

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **VS Code Test Detection Issues**:
   - VS Code's test explorer requires successful file compilation before showing tests
   - Test files with import errors prevent VS Code from detecting any tests in the project
   - Missing Vitest extension prevents proper integration with VS Code's test runner

2. **Post-Refactor Import Path Issues**:
   - Component reorganization into domain-based folders broke existing test import paths
   - 10+ test files still using old component import paths from before the refactor
   - Test files unable to import moved components causing compilation failures

#### Impact of Changes:
- **Test Discovery**: VS Code can now properly detect and display Vitest tests in test explorer
- **Test Execution**: All test files can now compile and execute (with some test logic failures remaining)
- **Developer Experience**: Tests are visible and runnable from VS Code interface
- **Import Consistency**: All test imports updated to match new component structure

#### Issues Resolved:
- **VS Code Extension**: Installed Vitest extension (`vitest.explorer`) for proper test detection
- **Import Path Updates**: Fixed 10+ test files with broken component import paths:
  - `HomeCard.vue` → `components/debug/HomeCard.vue`
  - `ComplexityCreateDialog.vue` → `components/references/ComplexityCreateDialog.vue`
  - `ConfigDisplayCard.vue` → `components/debug/ConfigDisplayCard.vue`
  - `DebugInfoCard.vue` → `components/debug/DebugInfoCard.vue`
  - `OrganizationCreateDialog.vue` → `components/organization/OrganizationCreateDialog.vue`
  - `PriorityCreateDialog.vue` → `components/references/PriorityCreateDialog.vue`
  - `StatusCreateDialog.vue` → `components/references/StatusCreateDialog.vue`
  - `TeamViewDialog.vue` → `components/teams/TeamViewDialog.vue`
  - `UserViewDialog.vue` → `components/users/UserViewDialog.vue`
  - `DepartmentTreeDialog.vue` → `components/organization/DepartmentTreeDialog.vue`
  - `StaffTreeDialog.vue` → `components/organization/StaffTreeDialog.vue`

#### Solution Summary:
The issue was caused by our component refactor breaking test import paths. VS Code couldn't detect tests because the files had compilation errors. After installing the Vitest extension and fixing all import paths, tests are now discoverable and executable in VS Code.

#### Technical Details:
- **Tests Status**: ✅ Discoverable in VS Code, ✅ Compilation successful, ⚠️ Some test logic failures remain
- **Extension Installed**: `vitest.explorer` for VS Code test integration
- **Files Updated**: 11 test files with corrected import paths
- **Test Runner**: Vitest integration now working properly in VS Code

#### Remaining Issues:
- Minor test assertion failures in validation and loading tests (unrelated to component refactor)
- Some TypeScript type compatibility issues in older test files (pre-existing)
- These are test logic issues, not discovery/import problems

#### Follow-up Actions:
- Monitor VS Code test discovery functionality
- Address remaining test assertion failures as separate task
- Update test documentation to reflect new component structure
