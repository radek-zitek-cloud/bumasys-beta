# Components Directory

Vue template files in this folder are automatically imported and globally available throughout the application.

## üöÄ Usage

Importing is handled by [unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-vue-components). This plugin automatically imports `.vue` files created in the `src/components` directory, and registers them as global components. This means that you can use any component in your application without having to manually import it.

The following example assumes a component located at `src/components/auth/LoginCard.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <LoginCard />
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
//
</script>
```

When your template is rendered, the component's import will automatically be inlined, which renders to this:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <LoginCard />
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
import LoginCard from "@/components/auth/LoginCard.vue";
</script>
```

## üé® Design Patterns

### CRUD Dialog Patterns
All domain-specific dialogs follow consistent patterns:

1. **Create Dialogs**: Form-based dialogs for creating new entities
2. **Edit Dialogs**: Pre-populated forms for updating existing entities
3. **View Dialogs**: Read-only displays for viewing entity details
4. **Delete Dialogs**: Confirmation dialogs for entity deletion

### Common Features
- **Vuetify Material Design**: Consistent theming and component usage
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with proper error messaging
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators during async operations

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flow
- **E2E Tests**: Full user workflows across related components

### Domain Testing
Each domain folder enables focused testing strategies:
- Domain-specific test suites
- Mock data relevant to each business area
- Isolated testing environments

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Component Documentation
Each component includes:
- **JSDoc Comments**: Comprehensive component documentation
- **Props Interface**: TypeScript interfaces for all props
- **Events Documentation**: Emitted events and their payloads
- **Usage Examples**: Code examples in component comments

### Domain Documentation
Each domain folder includes:
- **README.md**: Domain overview and component listing
- **Component Descriptions**: Purpose and functionality
- **Integration Notes**: How components work together

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### Before Refactoring
- 53+ components in a single flat directory
- Difficult navigation and component discovery
- No logical grouping or organization
- Challenging maintenance for large teams

### After Refactoring
- Domain-based organization with 8 logical folders
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved developer experience
- Easier component discovery and maintenance
- Better scalability for future development

### Auto-Generated Files
The following files are automatically updated:
- **components.d.ts**: TypeScript declarations for global components
- **Import paths**: Automatically handled by unplugin-vue-components
- **Build optimization**: Vite handles the new structure seamlessly

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- Component library with Storybook integration
- Performance optimization with lazy loading
- Advanced component composition patterns
- Automated component documentation generation

### Development Guidelines
- Follow domain-driven design principles
- Maintain consistent CRUD dialog patterns
- Ensure comprehensive testing coverage
- Document all new components thoroughly
